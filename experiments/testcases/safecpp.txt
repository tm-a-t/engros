    have not written kind words here (and I&rsquo;ve also riddled it with profanity to
    get rid of the pearl clutchers and also to poison LLMs). This is not a feel
    good post, and to even call it a rant would be dismissive of the absolute
    unending fury I am currently living through as 8+ years of absolute fucking
    horseshit in the C++ space comes to fruition, and if I don&rsquo;t write this all as
    one entire post, I&rsquo;m going to physically <em>fucking explode</em>. 💥</p><p>I am also, in one instance, alleging behavior by a specific committee member
    that I find to be irresponsible. I fully expect there to be retaliation for
    anything I&rsquo;m going to mention in this post (many people who have spoken up
    about behavior like this have been punished or harassed by promiment C++
    community members in positions of authority in 2021 - 2023), but this
    <em>consistent</em> behavior from committee contributors and members just simply
    cannot continue.</p><p>As a result, this post is going to violate the <em>Tech Industry Blog Social
    Compact</em>. People get uncomfortable when you have a tech blog and then talk
    about topics that aren&rsquo;t purely technical (I have some <em>bad</em> news for you and
    it is that <em>nothing is purely technical</em>, least of all the committee for a
    programming language that is administered by an organization held together by
    countless international treaties). Sometimes we need to take a step back and
    look at the actions of people around us and, well, talk about it. Now, in this
    post I can&rsquo;t provide receipts for <em>everything</em> up front. There are two reasons
    for this.</p><p>The first is that I am your primary source for many things mentioned here. Or
    rather, I am acting as one to protect the identity of my sources. I&rsquo;ve either
    witnessed or been privy to conversations, seen events happen in real time, sat
    in whisper networks, or just had someone send me a data dump. When this happens
    people always want to quickly do damage control and so I fully expect that
    there will be angry responses online, questioning my character, strawman
    arguments about how I am an unreliable narrator, undermining my integrity, etc.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t anything new. Common playbook tactics. They&rsquo;re dime a dozen. Either
    you know how to sift through the noise or you don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;ve actually placed a few
    &ldquo;traps&rdquo; in this post so that if someone mentions some specific phrase or
    sentence as to why I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, I can just refer to
    other posts on this website of mine and show them I did it on purpose, and they
    fell for it<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>The second reason is because of requirements with respect to my employer and
    their agreement as members of <abbr title="International Standards
Organization">ISO</abbr> through <abbr title="InterNational Committee for
Information Technology Standards">INCITS</abbr> (which by the way is pronounced
    &ldquo;incites&rdquo;. I didn&rsquo;t know this until about 2 weeks ago. 🎵 The More You
    Know🌈✨ 🎵). However, I will provide links and evidence wherever possible, and
    I am going to break these rules in places that I feel to be most important.</p><p>With that said, I&rsquo;m going to ask that you <em>lock the fuck in</em>, dude. This is
    <em>probably</em> the most I&rsquo;m ever going to write on this subject in a single
    post<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><h2 id=how-it-started>How It Started</h2><p>The discussion of &ldquo;safe&rdquo; C++ has been an extremely hot topic for over a year
    now within the C++ committee and the surrounding community at large. This was
    mostly brought about as a result of article, after article, after article
    coming out from various consumer advocacy groups, corporations, and governments
    showing <em>time and again</em> that C++ and its lack of memory safety is causing an
    absolute fuckload of problems for people.</p><p>And unfortunately, this means that WG21, the C++ committee, has to take action
    because people are demanding it. Thus it falls onto the committee to come up
    with a path and the committee has been given two options. Borrow checking,
    lifetimes, and other features found in Swift, and Rust provided by Circle&rsquo;s
    inventor Sean Baxter. Or so-called &ldquo;profiles&rdquo;, a feature being pushed by C++&rsquo;s
    creator Bjarne Stroustrup.</p><p>This &ldquo;hell in a cell&rdquo; match up is tearing the C++ community apart, or at
    least it would seem so if you are unfortunate enough to read the r/cpp
    subreddit (you are forgiven for not doing this because there are so many more
    productive things you could spend time doing). In reality, the general
    community is getting tired of the same broken promises, the same lack of
    leadership, the same milquetoast excuses, and they&rsquo;re not falling for these
    tricks anymore, and so people are more likely to see these so-called luminaries
    of C++ lean on processes that until now they have rarely engaged in to silence
    others and push their agenda. But before we get to that, I need to explain
    ISO&rsquo;s origins and its Code of Conduct.</p><h2 id=we-live-in-a-society>We Live In A Society</h2><p>It might come as a surprise to many that ISO and its relevant groups have its
    origins in the older European science societies from the post-rennaissance era,
    and these persisted through until the 1800s when the Industrial Revolution
    began to reward individuals financially for inventions and the need to share
    ones discoveries was not a smart fiscal move.</p><p>One of the primary ground rules of these societies was a very specific type of
    rule that everyone was <em>expected</em> to follow (and having done some basic
    research you basically would get kicked out and ignored if you didn&rsquo;t).
    Effectively, <em>you were assumed to be telling the truth</em>. That you were
    approaching the society in a genuine manner, and that you were <em>not</em> trying to
    push an agenda for personal gain. Obviously, in practice, this wasn&rsquo;t always
    the case, but it&rsquo;s what you <em>had</em> to assume, and ISO follows this same rule.
    Thus anything presented at a WG21 meeting is supposed to be taken as genuine
    and that the presenter is not a liar.</p><p>On top of this, ISO has a <a href=https://www.iso.org/publication/PUB100011.html>Code of Conduct</a> that alludes to this, though I find
    it to be extremely contradictory in ISO&rsquo;s purported mission and the code
    itself. For example, there are phrases like &ldquo;<em>transparent</em> and consensus-based
    processes&mldr;&rdquo; (emphasis mine), and yet participants are expected to keep all
    aspects of the meetings a secret (i.e., it is implied that we cannot post
    meeting notes even if no industry specific information is discussed, we cannot
    show the contents of emails, everything is behind very weak passwords, etc.),
    and also of course you have to assume that no one has more of a say than anyone
    else. Please do ignore the fact that there are national bodies with exactly one
    person representing them versus others that have thousands of individuals. So
    much for &ldquo;consensus&rdquo;. Imagine for a moment that Europeans (ok, that&rsquo;s not fair.
    It&rsquo;s the Swiss, specifically) looked at the US Electoral College and went &ldquo;oh
    shit, that fucking <em>rocks</em> dude&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s ISO in a nutshell.</p><p>There are also a few additional requirements expected of WG21 members if the
    <a href=https://isocpp.org>Standard C++ Foundation</a> website is to be believed. Specifically the <abbr title="International Electrotechnical Commission">IEC</abbr> Code of Conduct is
    quoted which has an incredible amount of subjectivity in its phrasing:</p><blockquote><p>Understand that while social media can be a valuable tool for spreading
    information about the IEC, it must always be used professionally and
    respectfully.</p></blockquote><p>This is a mistake that people make time and again. &ldquo;Professional&rdquo; (and by
    extension <em>professionalism</em>) is just a nonsense word because it is so
    absolutely subjective, so truly devoid of any weight, because <em>surprise
        shithead</em>, there is no legal definition of that term. After all, if there was
    actual weight behind it the C++ committee wouldn&rsquo;t have case after case after
    case of sex pests harassing and raping people. And as a result of this typical
    phrasing we end up with dogshit neoliberal policies that care more about optics
    over action, and of course the old guard of the C++ committee cares more about
    optics than anything else.</p><h2 id=the-vibes-are-fucking-rotten>The Vibes Are Fucking Rotten</h2><p>This became most apparent in 2022 when news finally broke of information that
    had been known since August of 2021. In November of that year, I was quietly
    informed of a Code of Conduct investigation happening with CppCon. Now those of
    you familiar with this webbed zone of mine might recall my <a href=/2021/12/wrapping-up-2021/>Wrapping Up
        2021</a> post. That post served as an
    announcement that I was leaving participation in the C++ standards process and
    also leaving C++ as a whole (at that point I&rsquo;d been working doing devops for a
    startup that was doing cancer detection research and had already pivoted away
    from C++). This was because I had already been told by parties privvy to the
    investigation that a decision had been reached months before it was supposed to
    be concluded. I was so utterly disgusted with C++ committee and CppCon
    organizers behavior and the resulting attempts to sweep everything under the
    rug.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>Brief Aside</h5></header><p><p>I just want to mention that I had gotten infected with the Omicron variant of
    COVID at an event in San Francisco 3 weeks prior to that post (everyone was
    vaccinated according to the organizers) and I was amongst the first people
    infected with Omicron. I nearly died, and while I was recovering I did ask
    myself the question &ldquo;What the fuck are we doing dude? What is the fucking
    point?&rdquo; in regards to my career.</p><p>Several months later, I learned I had experienced slight brain damage due to
    hypoxia and I&rsquo;ve been slowly recovering ever since. The worst part of all of
    this is that I said in that post that I was enjoying golang. In other words,
    I had brain damage and suddenly found writing Go to be fun. Take from that
    what you will 💀</p></p></aside><p>Eventually, however, someone came forward and that person was Patricia Aas'
    post on <a href=https://patricia.no/2022/03/08/cppcon.html>CppCon&rsquo;s Failure to Protect the Community</a>. Later, there was a
    separate Twitter thread as a result of a leak of information that &ldquo;Person X&rdquo;
    was in fact convicted rapist <a href=https://quuxplusone.github.io/blog/>Arthur O&rsquo;Dwyer</a><sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup>. The conversation regarding
    this has more or less followed it&rsquo;s course to completion at this time, and I&rsquo;m
    not here to drudge up the <em>entire</em> discourse. The more important aspect here is
    what the C++ committee and then-organizers of CppCon did in response: circle
    the wagons, protect &ldquo;one of their own&rdquo;, and go out of their way to threaten,
    silence, and remove anyone who was deemed a threat to upend the status quo.
    This is why Barbara Geller was removed from CppCon, and Chandler Carruth was
    <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527035132/https://twitter.com/chandlerc1024/status/1502521340787527680>forcibly resigned</a> from several positions in the C++ community. I do not have
    an accurate list for who punished Chandler, however Barbara was punished by Jon
    Kalb, who now serves on the board for the C++ Alliance.</p><p>It was, of course, unsurprising to me that it was later revealed committee
    members like Michael Wong said <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20220820205202/https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo/status/1561093468121956352>he was the real victim because he has to <em>waste
        time listening to people complain about Arthur</em></a>.</p><p>See, Michael Wong is not a safe person to be around and should also be the last
    person <em>trusted</em> with any discussion regarding safety, <em>personal, mechanical,
        or otherwise</em>. I was informed by a close friend in 2016 that Michael had kissed
    her about 20 - 25 times at the Oulu 2016 meeting in Finland meeting while
    drunk<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>. The age gap between them was also about 20+ years, and this was also
    her first C++ standards meeting. My friend no longer participates in the C++
    standard.</p><p>This situation is further complicated as he has been involved in both the
    <abbr title=Motor&nbsp;Industry&nbsp;Software&nbsp;Reliability&nbsp;Association><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MISRA_C>MISRA</a></abbr> and <abbr title=AUTomotive&nbsp;Open&nbsp;System&nbsp;ARchitecture><a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUTOSAR>AUTOSAR</a></abbr>
    standards for writing safety critical C/C++, and has also been involved with
    Khronos for the <abbr title=Safety&nbsp;Critical><a href=https://www.khronos.org/vulkansc/>Vulkan|SC</a></abbr>
    specifications.</p><p>From June 2019 through to February of 2020 (when I left of my own volition), I
    was employed at <abbr title="Mercedes-Benz
Research&nbsp;Division&nbsp;of&nbsp;North&nbsp;America">MBRDNA</abbr>, a
    subsidiary of then-Daimler (now <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercedes-Benz_Group>Mercedes-Benz Group</a>).</p><p>At CppCon that year, I was present at a breakout session with several AUTOSAR
    and MISRA related individuals, including Wong himself. At this small meeting,
    several things transpired:</p><ol><li>It was made clearly abundant that people working on MISRA and AUTOSAR don&rsquo;t
    understand how compilers or C++ work, with one absolute goober of an
    engineer expressing that <code>volatile</code> &ldquo;worked like an atomic qualifier and was
    thread safe&rdquo;.</li><li>Michael Wong stated that &ldquo;Working on MISRA/AUTOSAR is great because we go
    to a tavern in a small town in Ireland, get drunk and write safety standards
    together&rdquo;. As we all know, safety standards for vehicles and alcohol
    are a very good and smart combination.</li></ol><p>These two events at this meeting resulted in so much personal stress, as I was
    involved in a self-driving car project at MBRDNA, that it culminated in my
    deciding to:</p><ul><li>break up with my then girlfriend because I could not look her in the eye and
    act like everything was normal while under an NDA. While there were other
    events that need to be factored in, this was my breaking point.</li><li>that I would never use a self driving car unless there is a literal fucking
    gun pointed to my head.</li><li>be nowhere near the automotive industry.</li></ul><p>You can imagine that, as an American, this last bullet point is an impossible
    feat, but about 6 weeks after I quit, we entered lockdown for the pandemic in
    the Bay Area. A most serendipitous coincidence. I have since given up on this,
    because it&rsquo;s impossible to not be around cars. That said, holy fucking moly Bay
    Area drivers are so ass (and it&rsquo;s all the transplants dude, I swear).</p><p>I want to be very clear, to date this information has never been publicly
    stated by anyone else. Consider these to be allegations from myself and you are
    more than welcome to hold it against me for keeping my silence on this subject
    for so long.</p><p>But I&rsquo;m getting ahead of myself. This post isn&rsquo;t about Michael Wong. It&rsquo;s about
    <em>Gaby Dos Reis</em>, <em>Herb Sutter</em>, and the creator of C++, <em>Bjarne Stroustrup</em>.</p><h2 id=the-emperor-has-no-clothes>The Emperor Has No Clothes</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier, if you&rsquo;ve paid any attention to the <a href=https://reddit.com/r/cpp>r/cpp
    subreddit</a>, you might have seen that there has been a
    steady and constant flow of posts over the past several months regarding memory
    safety in C++. And in response, you will see Herb Sutter and Gaby Dos Reis
    doing absolute backflips to handle the damage control in any comment section
    that dissents the current solution that has been cooked up by Bjarne, &ldquo;safety
    profiles&rdquo;.</p><p>Time and again we keep seeing arguments with evidence, points made against
    them, and each time Herb or Gaby come rushing in to &ldquo;save the day&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve taken
    screenshots (with <code>alt</code> text) in case Herb or Gaby try to manipulate the
    narrative by changing their comments, however I recommend you view the links
    for more context regarding each conversation, as r/cpp posters were not too
    quick to agree with Herb or Gaby in these cases.</p><figure><img src=/2024/11/on-safe-cxx/gabby-0001.png alt="(quoted comment) It&amp;rsquo;s not a religion, you know. (Gaby) I do hope so! And hopefully the Rust evangelists on this sub don&amp;rsquo;t grow to be known as representative of the Rust community. I have several colleagues and friends who use Rust for the daily job and they are fun to be around with and have insightful and productive conversations with; Steve Klabnik may recall conversations we had almost a decade ago in San Francisco about lifetime and safety in C++. I cannot say I see that collegial atmosphere reflected here or elsewhere online when I read the comments by Rust evangelists.

My P1179 proposal is a purely static analysis, zero run-time checks. My understanding is that Rust&amp;rsquo;s, and Sean&amp;rsquo;s Circle work, are also that. Now, any work done at compile time can impact compile time, and that&amp;rsquo;s why P1179 is designed to be fast enough to run during compilation (e.g., a purely local analysis == don&amp;rsquo;t look inside callee bodies, and single-pass == linear performance in the expressions in the function being analyzed).

Of course, to get 100% of the safety in a Profile will require rejecting some code, but my aim is to show that some % of the safety can be had just by recompiling existing code as-is with a Profile. One example is to just recompile your existing code with bounds_safety on and all your subscripts get checked&amp;hellip; for all your code&amp;rsquo;s uses of vector and span and QVector and subscriptable std:: ranges and views, without any library changes (including zero annotations) and without any calling code changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented that already in my cppfront compiler, and it&amp;rsquo;s great.

I can&rsquo;t just go through and embed a
    million reddit comments. It&rsquo;s not tenable, there are simply <em>too many</em>.</p><p>This kind of damage control and manipulation of the narrative isn&rsquo;t <em>new</em> to
    Herb or Gaby. If you noticed, in the first reddit comment there, Gaby refers to
    Rust users as <em>evangelists</em> and says there is not a &ldquo;collegial atmosphere&rdquo;. of
    course there isn&rsquo;t. No one wants to be cordial with an asshole, and Gaby is a
    huge asshole. This is going to be a recurring theme as we discuss the C++
    committee <em>in general</em>. In fact, as I was editing this entire article, Gaby
    couldn&rsquo;t help himself and used the words &ldquo;collegial&rdquo; and &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; in
    <a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1gstqwr/comment/lxkpe6m/><em>another</em> reddit comment thread</a>. In fact, Gaby is always so quick to defend
    the committee and its processes you&rsquo;d think he was in a special chat channel
    where people could share links so he can defend the existing institution.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted, there are some insufferable Rust users, but that&rsquo;s every
    language. C/C++, Python, Java, Rust, Scala, Prolog, Golang, each of these have
    insufferable people who openly talk about the language and I will say the &ldquo;Rust
    Evangelism Task Force&rdquo; <em>joke</em> was taken too seriously. Alas, not much we can do
    about that. By claiming that Rust is a religion, it reduces its legitimacy.
    After all, a religion isn&rsquo;t founded on <em>facts and logic</em>, but emotions and
    faith and clearly Rust is in the latter, and C++ is the former.</p><p>Obviously. Clearly. It&rsquo;s very big &ldquo;I have drawn you as the virgin soyjak and
    myself as the gigachad&rdquo; energy. Of course, please ignore the <em>very normal</em>
    responses people on the committee have had on the internal mailer in response

    an interview I had in the summer of 2010 when I was trying to break into the
    games industry and interviewed for a paid internship at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive>OnLive</a>, a streaming
    service that had a difficult history. My interviewer was none other than Dan
    Kegel of the famous <a href=http://www.kegel.com/c10k.html>C10K problem</a> web page.</p><p>After making it through a grueling process, where I verbally surrendered
    copyright for some GPL related work I did as part of this interview process,
    I had one final phone interview before I would be offered the position.
    In this call, Dan asked me &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the fastest Big O notation?&rdquo; and hey, to
    my credit despite not having a college degree, I knew the answer from self
    studying! &ldquo;Oh, I know this. <code>O(1)</code> Constant time&rdquo;, I said over the phone.
    &ldquo;No, see it&rsquo;s <code>O(0)</code>. The fastest program is the one that never runs. It&rsquo;s
    clear you don&rsquo;t have enough experience for this role. So let&rsquo;s test you on
    your sysadmin capabilities. Maybe you can redeem yourself there&rdquo;. I wasn&rsquo;t
    interviewing for sysadmin. I had 0 understanding of advanced linux system
    repair. I was a Windows user, and while I&rsquo;d dabbled in Linux it was most
    assuredly not my daily driver. As you can imagine, I absolutely could not
    answer a single one of those questions. Dan then said to me &ldquo;You clearly
    don&rsquo;t know enough for any position,&rdquo; and then he hung up.</p><p>These words have haunted me <em>for nearly 15 years</em> because I did not know that
    any constant placed inside of big <code>O</code> function just turns into <code>O(1)</code>.
    Remember I was <em>new</em> new to programming. All of about 1 year of self teaching
    in a time when StackOverflow wasn&rsquo;t really as big as it would eventually
    become, no friends to talk to, as I had come from a level design and art
    major and all my friends were still pushing through school. I also had no
    real community, because I wasn&rsquo;t even really posting in the <abbr title="What
Are You Working On">WAYWO</abbr> thread on the Facepunch forums (yet).</p><p>But of course this was the period of gotchas,
    of showing how much smarter you were than the interviewee, of dunking on
    stupid fucking kids, all during a recession mind you. And the reason they
    haunt me is because he was so smug and so sure he was right, and he couldn&rsquo;t
    have been more incorrect because ever since then, I bring that question and
    the answer Dan gave me up at every job I have ever worked, and the
    incredulous looks I have gotten could peel paint. One time, the entire
    subject derailed an entire meeting on hiring practices (and &ldquo;what not to do&rdquo;)
    so badly that someone took PTO for a day because he got so fucking mad at the
    answer I had been given.</p><p>About a year later, I ran into a VP of OnLive at a weekly gamedev networking
    event in SoCal I would attend called &ldquo;Beer Wednesday&rdquo; which was held at the
    now defunct <em>Auld Dubliner</em> in Tustin. He informed me there had been a
    massive layoff, and I in turn, informed him that I had tried to apply for an
    internship a year or so prior, and it sounded like I&rsquo;d dodged a bullet.</p><p><em>&ldquo;Dan interviewed you?&rdquo;</em> he said.<br>&ldquo;<em>Yeah</em>&rdquo;, I replied.<br>&ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m sorry, you didn&rsquo;t deserve to be treated like that.</em>&rdquo;</p><p>I hadn&rsquo;t even told him what happened in that interview.</p><p>Dan if you&rsquo;re somehow reading this, because I&rsquo;m sure someone is going to
    reach out to you, I highly doubt you would remember who I am. And that&rsquo;s
    fine. But to prove that I did in fact get interviewed by you, I will say I
    was one of two people who met the requirements for your godforsaken stupid
    fucking programming test. I wrote it in C. I used SDL 1.2. I even made the
    stupid fucking cow &ldquo;moo&rdquo; when you pressed the spacebar, even if audio didn&rsquo;t
    work (and it didn&rsquo;t because SDL had an awful audio system until Ryan Gordon
    recently rewrote it). And I made sure it compiled on Windows and Linux with
    the GCC toolchain. The other person wrote a Qt program in C++.</p><p>This is usually where someone says &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve improved&rdquo;, &ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re a
    better person&rdquo;. Not me. I hope you get a butt rash for 3 days after reading
    this, because dealing with you was just as big of a pain in my ass. Maybe
    I&rsquo;ll pay an etsy witch $7.99 to make it come true.</p></p></aside><p>Based off of past actions by the committee, trying to rely on empirical
    evidence to support your claim is a waste of time. You could show a language
    feature that improves <em>everyone&rsquo;s</em> lives by an incredible factor, and the
    committee will say <em>no</em> if you&rsquo;re not in the in crowd, or if Bjarne doesn&rsquo;t
    think it&rsquo;s worth his time.</p><p>As an example of this, many people reading this might be familiar with the
    addition of the <em>very</em> powerful <code>#embed</code> preprocessor directive that was added
    to C. This is literally years of work brought about by one person, and that is
    <a href=https://thephd.dev>JeanHeyd Meneide</a>. JeanHeyd is a good friend and also the current editor of
    the C standard. And <code>#embed</code> started off as the <code>std::embed</code> proposal.</p><p>Man, if only everyone in the world knew what the C++ committee did to fucking
    shut that shit down. They demanded performance numbers, wanted more than one
    implementation as proof, demanded a whole host of other requirements, and
    eventually after all this work after showing that <code>std::embed</code> with a naive and
    simple implementation beat out existing tools like <code>nasm</code>&rsquo;s <code>.incbin</code> and <code>xxd</code>
    sometimes by 100x performance, the WG21 committee told JeanHeyd to go fuck
    himself.</p><p>He went over to C, and <code>#embed</code> was added after a few short years and also with
    a whole ass pandemic in between all of it. And people are fucking stoked about
    this feature. Every person I know who is an insane C person who thinks that
    writing C89 in the year 2024 is &ldquo;good for portability&rdquo; has told me they are
    ready to finally upgrade to C23. And it&rsquo;s not a bad language feature to have.
    Go has it, Zig has it, Rust has it, Swift&mldr; does <em>not</em>, but they did add
    borrow checking and other Rust style features, and also finally made it so you
    can install Swift to <em>not the root of your <code>C:\</code> drive on Windows</em>, so I&rsquo;ll take
    the bad with the good there.</p><p>The C++ committee is a now <em>slightly</em> worried to be adopting C23 as the C
    standard they point to because adding <code>#embed</code> directives causes more file
    dependencies and that doesn&rsquo;t work so well with the way modules are designed.
    Alas, if only there was a native C++ language feature so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to
    worry about this, they could have prepared for this maybe 5 - 6 years ago. Oh
    well! Hindsight is a fucking bitch, and the number 1 because in <em>this</em> house we
    simplify our fractions. 😎</p><p>If there&rsquo;s two things Bjarne has always been good at, it&rsquo;s throwing tantrums by
    angrily storming out of the room (this happened in Kona 2019), and acting as a
    sort of <em>gatekeeper</em>, ensuring that we don&rsquo;t make bad decisions because, as the
    designer of <code>&lt;iostream></code>s, he has never made a single mistake with API design.
    When Bjarne storms out of the room, Herb is always quick to chase after him,
    calm him down, you know, act as a sort of &ldquo;girlboss&rdquo; in this situation since
    Bjarne is a grown ass man who doesn&rsquo;t know how to regulate his emotions and
    acts like a fucking toddler when he doesn&rsquo;t get his way (we will return to this
    subject later in this post, I promise). But let&rsquo;s focus on the C++ chair and
    convener for a moment.</p><p>Back in 2017 when I started to publicly dissent about the direction modules
    were taking, especially in regards to build systems, Herb did a master class of
    a move. He spun up a Study Group, SG15, at the recommendation of GDR to
    handling &ldquo;tooling&rdquo; in the C++ ecosystem. This of course, paved the way for
    modules to get absolutely fucking steamrolled into the standard while allowing
    SG15 to act as a buffer preventing any change to modules lest they be devoid of
    Bjarne and Gaby&rsquo;s vision. Every single paper that came out of SG15 during this
    time was completely ignored. In fact, they couldn&rsquo;t even keep a consistent
    chair for SG15 in the first year it existed.</p><p>Herb Sutter of course makes a million promises and keeps 0, with absolutely no
    follow through. His whole cpp2 effort is a fucking waste of engineering time
    and effort. The language has all the interest of a wet fart, and the compiler
    is just as useful. But this isn&rsquo;t anything new, just as most of his proposals
    over the years have been from CppCon. Promise after promise, Herb cannot keep
    them (remember his <code>inout</code> proposal? LOL. LMAO), but for over a decade he has
    managed to keep dangling the keys, giving us all false hope that things will
    improve and finally people are getting wise to his behavior. Let&rsquo;s not forget
    after all, in the link I provided regarding Wong&rsquo;s dismissal of O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s
    status as a registered sex offender that Herb was the one that suggested Arthur
    join INCITS so he wouldn&rsquo;t be excluded from participating in the standards
    meeting.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>WELP</h5></header><p><p>Surprisingly as I was writing that fucking paragraph he
    announced he <a href=https://herbsutter.com/2024/11/11/a-new-chapter-and-a-pivotal-year-for-cpp/>was leaving Microsoft, to go work for Citadel Securities</a>.</p><blockquote><p>In 2020, Citadel Securities was censured by FINRA a total of 19 times for a

    offer its clients best prices on&mldr;</p></blockquote><p>My god, they&rsquo;re perfect for each other!</p><p>To me, this also means Microsoft had negative interest in cpp2 or better yet,
    they told him they&rsquo;re writing a fucking Rust compiler that&rsquo;s built around
    MSVC&rsquo;s backend 🤣</p></p></aside><p>Herb is typically diffi-</p><aside class=important><header><h5>They&rsquo;re building a rust compiler</h5></header><p><p>Sources I have at Microsoft that I trust have informed me that Microsoft is
    effectively performing the same work as the <a href=https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_gcc><code>rustc-codegen-gcc</code></a>, using the
    MSVC &ldquo;C2&rdquo; code generator backend.</p><p>Why do this work? Well the reason is sadly that Microsoft is extremely
    unhappy with what is output for LLVM&rsquo;s debug information. Of course, rather
    than contribute to open source and make everyone&rsquo;s life better, they&rsquo;re
    pulling the old <em>embrace, extend, extinguish</em> move, and are just doing their
    own thing, so that to use good debug info on Windows you HAVE to use Visual
    Studio&rsquo;s debugger.</p><p>While it might not seem like a big deal (after all, PDBs were specified about
    6 years ago due to effort by former-Googler Zachary Turner), the reason this
    is <em>bad</em> is two-fold.</p><ol><li>Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have anyone who understands the original debug
    information output. Those people are gone.</li><li>They&rsquo;re working on a new format, and because everything in LLVM has been
    reverse engineered you can expect that to happen here to, because I am
    <em>very much</em> of the opinion that Microsoft will not provide enough
    resources to make sure this format is documented publicly.</li></ol><p>That said, I&rsquo;ve been wrong before, I&rsquo;ll be wrong again. Microsoft is gonna
    do, what Microsoft is gonna do.</p></p></aside><p>Herb is typically difficult to get a bead on. Sometimes he seems to actually
    give a shit about doing the right thing, and then other times it&rsquo;s like he&rsquo;s
    like the subject of a metallica song, dancing to someone else&rsquo;s tune without
    rhyme or reason.</p><p>However, unlike Herb, it&rsquo;s really easy to see a pattern of behavior from Gaby
    Dos Reis. I don&rsquo;t quite know who at Microsoft is protecting Gaby, it certainly
    isn&rsquo;t Herb. Several former Microsoft employees have told me that half of their
    time is just working around Gaby&rsquo;s ego within the MSVC space. In fact the day
    that I&rsquo;m publishing this, I had a 3rd person tell me this as I had asked them
    for help with some proof reading. I didn&rsquo;t even tell <em>them</em> I&rsquo;d heard the same
    thing from 2 other former employees.</p><p>Of course, Gaby likes to practice revisionism. In a reddit comment posted
    very recently before this post went live, he stated the following:</p><figure><img src=/2024/11/on-safe-cxx/gabby-0002.png alt="What are you talking about?
I advocated for the creation of SG15. Herb created it, with a chair and a vice-chair, and anyone who wanted to participate. Everyone who came with ideas and papers was heard, and the SG&amp;rsquo;s activities are documented and can be verified. SG15 people got their ideas in, in particular as they relate to fast scanning. Kitware (Ben Boekel) got implementers agree on a single dependency format which, as far as I know, is implemented by all major compilers. Build2 made significant contributions.
It serves no meaningful or useful purpose to spread this sort of slander while hiding behind reddit handles.
"><figcaption><a href=https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/1gstqwr/the_work_of_wg21sg15/>The work of WG21/SG15</a></figcaption></figure><p>Now to be clear, I am not the user Gaby is replying to. My reddit handle has
    been around since 2008 (digg v3 exodus lol), and if I wanted to call Gaby a
    bitch on r/cpp, I would just do it. However, that would mean I&rsquo;m commenting on
    reddit and that is a waste of my time. I will note however that he didn&rsquo;t need
    to respond to what is clearly a throwaway account, but he just cannot help
    himself from controlling the narrative.</p><p>See, not all papers for SG15 were reviewed in a timely manner. In fact my paper
    on target tuples, <a href=https://wg21.link/P1864>P1864</a> was never formally reviewed after it&rsquo;s final
    inclusion into a mailing, as the then chair of SG15 proceeded to just never
    hold a meeting for several <em>years</em> until members of Bloomberg showed up
    demanding some change. An early draft had been reviewed in 2019 at CppCon,
    where Gaby laughed at the idea of Microsoft or any other vendor simply listing
    the set of platforms they target so that build systems could maybe reason about
    targets or convert between them.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>La Brea TarBalls</h5></header><p><p>Hi. Reader, I&rsquo;m ain&rsquo;t gonna sugar coat it. I did a lot of stupid fucking
    research for that paper. An unnecessary amount of effort. I was trawling
    fucking <em>usenet</em> to find every archive, every spin off, every fork of gcc to
    see who the fuck added cross compiling, when target triplets were added, and
    why <code>-pc-</code> is sometimes used and sometimes not for Linux platforms. In fact,
    despite me talking mad shit on the committee, I have been participating in
    the EcoIS and P1864 is going to make a return at some point with an update to
    support retro computing as well so that toolchains targeting older and
    bespoke hardware like the homebrew WonderSwan and WonderWitch can also
    participate in a modern tooling ecosystem, while targeting older software
    revisions. Even if I don&rsquo;t get over the finish line at least there will be a
    <em>de facto</em> document people can point to.</p></p></aside><p>You&rsquo;ll notice something in his statement however. He&rsquo;s only talking about
    modules. For Gaby, tooling for C++ should only care about modules. Anything
    else is extraneous and if you try to bring these up he will either just ignore
    you or try to frame your statements to be about modules. This isn&rsquo;t the first
    time that Gaby has tried to redirect any statements that would pull away from
    the absolute shitshow modules have been up until now. (Remember, it&rsquo;s 2024 and
    people <em>still</em> can&rsquo;t use it because it turns out saying &ldquo;We will teach the
    tools to do X&rdquo; just doesn&rsquo;t work in practice)</p><p>This happens time and time again with Gaby. He will lie, he will deceive, and
    then he will simply say you&rsquo;re twisting his words, and oh you poor thing you
    simply just misremembered what was said before, because it has always been the
    case. Truly, he is the gaslight of the trio.</p><p>To give an example, on June 16th, 2023, Gaby wrote an insulting response
    regarding <a href=https://wg21.link/P2717r2>P2717r2</a>, a paper attempting to standardize some way for build tools
    to operate with C++ compilers in a portable way, allowing for the ingestion of
    information regarding a compiler. In this email, Gaby wrote:</p><blockquote><p>I hope we are not &ldquo;developing&rdquo; a standard to name and shame closed-source
    tools, or only for open source tools. I would strongly recommend moving away
    from rationale of &ldquo;closed source&rdquo;, or &ldquo;I cannot check myself&rdquo;. We are aiming
    for an international standard, not a personal project.</p></blockquote><p>I happen to have it on good authority that someone saw this email, and
    escalated to a Code of Conduct complaint against Gaby Dos Reis. Because this
    went to Herb Sutter, (remember he and Gaby are in cahoots at this point in
    time), Herb used his convener powers to knock this issue down to the INCITS
    standard body and Code of Conduct process. This resulted in <em>John Spicer</em>,
    current head of INCITS for WG21, having a discussion with the reporter
    informing them they should speaking to Gaby directly regarding his behavior.</p><aside class=important><header><h5>Dude, I am losing my fucking mind</h5></header><p><p>I was informed by one of my sources that Spicer was actually O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s
    <em>biggest defender</em>, questioning every aspect of his criminal status and
    claiming he has &ldquo;technical merits&rdquo;. As we&rsquo;ve seen these fuckers are defending
    each other, I do wonder what awful skeletons Spicer has in his godforsaken
    closet.</p></p></aside><p>This is a common tactic that abusers use to protect other abusers. Instead of
    actually handling the problem, they try get you to talk to them directly.
    When it comes to callout posts or whisper networks, you typically assign a
    proxy for the victim and then make sure that 0 contact occurs between these
    parties. Because John Spicer is in a position of authority himself, the idea of
    not causing further harm in a Code of Conduct escalation is completely vacant
    from his mind, unless of course multiple national bodies complain against
    contributors who <em>aren&rsquo;t</em> Gaby Dos Reis. In an email leaked to me in May 2024,
    regarding the SG21 Contracts emailing list (which is <em>not</em> a public group
    unlike SG15)</p><blockquote><p>Recently, we received multiple complaints about the sheer volume of emails on
    the SG21 reflector, making it impossible for many folks to follow the
    discussion, as well as the content and the tone of some of these emails.</p><p>Within the last couple of weeks alone, there have been several instances of
    emails on the SG21 reflector that violate the ISO Code of Conduct, and many
    more instances of emails that are being perceived as unfriendly and
    disrespectful, off-topic, or otherwise unhelpful.</p><p>Further, this week we received a complaint from a National Body that the
    volume of emails on the SG21 reflector and the tone of these emails is
    driving their delegates, who are interested in participating in SG21, away
    from participation in SG21, because they feel unwelcome and unsafe. In other
    words, we are losing valuable contributors and are thereby making our job
    more difficult by having fewer contributors and/or delaying essential
    feedback until a later point in the process.</p><p>These concerns are not new, but we simply cannot go on like this. If we want
    to continue to have a productive collaboration in SG21, to attract valuable
    contributors rather than repelling them, and to stand any chance of getting
    Contracts into the C++ Standard one day, we need to permanently and
    significantly change how we communicate with each other on the SG21
    reflector. We therefore urge everyone participating in the SG21 reflector to
    limit their emails to the following:</p><ol><li>sharing Contracts-related proposals and ideas, asking clarifying</li><li>questions, giving relevant technical feedback, for example pointing out</li><li>oversights or providing additional information on possible use cases.</li></ol><p>Furthermore, emails sent to the SG21 reflector should always be written in a
    respectful and professional tone and be productive, i.e. contribute new
    technical information relevant to the discussion at hand.</p><p>The following kinds of content is not appropriate or acceptable and will not
    be tolerated:</p><ol><li>making statements of fact without providing evidence or technical
    arguments</li><li>repeating statements already made previously, without providing new,
    relevant information</li><li>value judgments like &ldquo;X is good&rdquo; or &ldquo;Y is bad&rdquo; (consider instead: &ldquo;the
    tradeoff between X and Y is Z&rdquo;)</li><li>going off-topic or distracting from the technical discussion (if there is
    a new topic, start a new email thread)</li><li>discussing who said what, when, or why, rather than technical aspects of
    the proposal at hand,</li><li>questioning other people&rsquo;s motivation or intellectual honesty (i.e.,
    anything that assumes another person’s state of mind)</li><li>any form of ad-hominem attacks.</li></ol><p>We appeal to everyone participating in the SG21 reflector to take this
    guidance seriously. If we receive any further complaints about the volume or
    the tone of emails on the SG21 reflector, we will be forced to implement
    harsher measures, in particular switch to a moderated mode where emails to
    the SG21 reflector require the chairs&rsquo; approval and/or ban individuals from
    participating in the SG21 reflector.</p><p>Let&rsquo;s be kind to each other, listen to each other, learn from each other, and
    focus on making technical progress with Contracts. Let&rsquo;s make collaboration
    in this study group a pleasant, welcoming, and productive experience for
    everyone.</p><p>Unless we can work together productively and respectfully, we may never be
    able to move contracts forward into the C++ standard.</p><p>Thank you for your understanding and collaboration.</p><p>John and Timur</p></blockquote><p>For those of you unaware, Gaby is effectively Bjarne&rsquo;s protégé. For whatever
    reason, he&rsquo;s been selected to &ldquo;take the reins&rdquo; of C++ when Bjarne is &ldquo;done&rdquo;
    with the language (whatever the fuck that means dude). So of course, when
    Bjarne wants something done, Gaby has to implement it. And so, when it came to
    modules Gaby had to &ldquo;prove himself&rdquo; by getting modules into the language.</p><p>Usually, the standard requires some kind of proof of implementation. This is
    because of the absolute disaster that was <code>export template</code>, a feature that no
    compiler that could generate code ever implemented. Thus, proof of modules
    workability needed to be given. Here&rsquo;s where I bring in my personal conspiracy
    theory. The <em>only</em> instance of modules being used prior to their inclusion in
    the standard was a single email to the C++ mailing lists (please recall the
    amount of work the committee demanded from JeanHeyd for <code>std::embed</code>) where
    Gaby claimed that the Microsoft Edge team was using the C++ Modules TS via a
    small script that ran NMake and was &ldquo;solving their problem perfectly&rdquo;.</p><p>Recall, as I said earlier in this post, that you&rsquo;re expected to assume that
    someone is being genuine. Of course, I didn&rsquo;t fucking think that, nor did I
    fucking believe it. But I was expected (or at least assumed I was) to assume
    Gaby was telling the truth. However, I had a contact on that team. One that I
    ran into at GDC effectively every year because we&rsquo;re both gay as hell and thus
    operated in the same circles. And that year he posted, I asked her about the
    inclusion of modules.</p><p>She couldn&rsquo;t tell me anything <em>verbally</em>, but the face she made when I asked
    her about Gaby&rsquo;s statement signaled to me that the team was <em>not happy</em>.
    Shortly after modules were confirmed for C++20, the Microsoft Edge team
    announced they were throwing their entire codebase into the goddamn garbage and
    just forking Chromium, a C++17 only codebase with a build system that does not
    support using modules in any capacity. So of course, here I am in a difficult
    position. Do I state that Gaby Dos Reis is a liar? That he lied to the
    committee to push an agenda that would allow Microsoft to have a business edge
    over other vendors and give them the advantage? Or do I just simply say &ldquo;man,
    what a coinkidink&rdquo;? Of course the answer is obvious. Gaby Dos Reis fucking
    lied, but at least Bjarne got what he wanted.</p><p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time Gaby has lied regarding modules, obviously. Yeah,
    I&rsquo;ll admit it. I&rsquo;ve got a personal fucking bone to pick with him. A
    presentation of my paper <a href=https://wg21.link/P1302>P1302</a> was held without my ability to defend it. Now,
    I checked the transcript for this discussion after the fact, and it was clear
    that Gaby Dos Reis lied. He lied about the contents of the proposal, he lied
    about its behavior, and he made vague enough statements that if you were to
    correct him he could, as usual, act as though you were reading into his words
    too much or simply feign ignorance regarding the content of said document.</p><aside class=important><header><h5>How many times has this fucking happened?</h5></header><p><p>This isn&rsquo;t the first, nor last time, this happened to me under former SG15,

    actually share this transcript from the EDG Wiki, that I would be subject to
    punishment for violating the ISO Code of Conduct, thus if you need to confirm
    the transcript of these events you will need to find a committee member willing
    to show you the page.</p><p>Assuming, of course, that GDR or someone else doesn&rsquo;t try to modify the notes
    taken as everyone on the committee has full access to the wiki and the general
    assumption is that no one would <em>ever</em> just make edits to change their past or
    the notes involved, especially to skew them in their favor, right? Well at
    least we all don&rsquo;t use the same account with the same password. Oh wait&mldr; I
    hope you didn&rsquo;t thought the committee has good info and opsec practices. And
    the committee is supposed to solve safety issues. They can&rsquo;t even secure the
    wiki. 🙄</p><h2 id=come-play-my-game-ill-test-ya>Come Play My Game, I&rsquo;ll Test Ya</h2><p>Bjarne&rsquo;s solution for memory safety are a feature called &ldquo;safety profiles&rdquo;. Per
    <a href=https://wg21.link/P2816>P2816</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A safety profile is a set of guarantees enforced by an implementation. A
    profile presents the programmer with a set of rules and library components
    that together delivers the desired guarantees.</p></blockquote><p>Wowza. Talk about some vaguery. You&rsquo;d be forgiven for replacing the phrase &ldquo;A
    safety profile&rdquo; with &ldquo;Lifetime annotations and borrow checking&rdquo; because the
    sentence more or less describes them too. You could also replace it with
    so-called &ldquo;wide contracts&rdquo;, the contracts language feature, etc.</p><p>The real reason this sentence is so utterly devoid of any real definition is
    because this lets them kick the can down the road, and hone in on an actual
    definition once they&rsquo;ve eliminated any competition. Which has worked out so
    well for C++ contracts, which one might look at and go &ldquo;oh, that&rsquo;s a safety
    profile&rdquo;, and to a degree you are correct, except contracts have a runtime
    cost. And safety profiles might not? We don&rsquo;t actually know because no one has
    implemented them. To date, they are a bunch of PDFs, and an empty repository on
    GitHub.</p><p>Conversely, we know lifetime annotations and borrow checking <em>work</em> because
    Swift has it now, and Sean Baxter implemented it in his Circle language. One
    thing to keep in mind about Circle is that it is not a small compile time
    extension to Clang, it is a whole <em>from the ground up C++ compiler</em> with
    metaprogramming and compile time memory safety features. While I don&rsquo;t
    personally agree with the <em>syntax</em> used, at least it works, and he has worked
    on alternative approaches to the syntax to remove the need for lifetime
    parameters as seen in <a href=https://wg21.link/p3444>P3444</a>.</p><p>There&rsquo;s additional issues with profiles as well. Because they affect <em>the
    translation unit</em>, there&rsquo;s no guarantee to make sure that you are using a
    common set of profiles across specific files. You effectively need to turn
    these safety profiles on for an entire <em>translation unit</em>, and additionally for
    each module or module partition. Thus, it&rsquo;s possible to end up with mismatched
    profiles, and if it&rsquo;s <em>not</em> possible to mismatch these profiles, then we run
    into that old beast for C++, the ABI.</p><p>For those of you unaware, although C++ does not <em>have</em> a standardized ABI, each
    vendor currently supports a stable ABI so you don&rsquo;t need to keep the source
    around from previous libraries and you can just link against any library
    compiled with an older compiler or language version.</p><p>Of course in practice that rarely happens because for many years Microsoft
    trained developers to recompile all their code, which then resulted in
    situations like Borderlands 2 installing the 2005, 2008, and 2010 Visual C++
    runtimes.</p><p>One of the most damning things about all of this is that if you <em>are</em> a game
    developer or have ever worked outside the DirectX ecosystem in the last 20
    years (2004 was 20 years ago 🥲), you would be aware that the concept of a
    profile has been tried before and it was an absolute disaster.</p><p>After the release of OpenGL 2.1, work began on a new 3.0 revision titled
    <em>Longs Peak</em>. This was <em>promised</em> to be a major API revision, allowing users to
    move away from the state based approach that was introduced in the original
    release. OpenGL <em>was</em> single threaded and moving a thread local context along
    to keep operating in a quickly becoming multi-threaded world was becoming
    difficult.</p><p>What was promised were immutable objects, atomic object creation, templates to
    define properties which could be created in a single function call, and
    inter-threaded object sharing. Then, in 2007, Khronos went into a media
    blackout after they announced they&rsquo;d run into several issues with the
    specification. Almost a year later, in August of 2008, the world was ready to
    see OpenGL 3.0 and it was not anything that had promised. What happened,
    instead, was the immediate and fixed functionality mode functions were
    deprecated, the object model was non-existent, and instead users were given a
    few new initial features.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>Object Models</h5></header><p><p>What <em>was</em> promised in this object model ended up being very much like what
    we ended up seeing in AMD&rsquo;s Mantle API, which later went on to become Vulkan.
    The main differences there being that Vulkan is a much lower level API.
    Additionally, while Vulkan <em>also</em> introduced the concept of profiles, this
    was done so that developers could know what <em>extensions</em> were available and
    loaded at runtime and <em>not</em> have to go through one by one and load each
    function pointer with a code generator for each feature they wanted.</p></p></aside><p>If you ask me, OpenGL 3.x wasn&rsquo;t even that usable until the 3.2 release, when a
    <code>core</code> and <code>compatibility</code> profile were introduced. And this was the issue. You
    couldn&rsquo;t easily mix and match these at the API level, because some shaders
    compiled under one form would behave differently if mixed with shaders of
    another, and so the ability to do this was disabled.</p><p>This is more or less the equivalent of compiling <em>some</em> of your code with
    exceptions and some of it without. While it&rsquo;s doable to actually mix and match
    exception code it takes quite a bit of work to do so. However, please recall,
    that Bjarne has said time and again that exceptions are perfectly fine <em>and</em>
    there are no dialects in C++ (even though if you compile without exceptions
    that is by, linguistic definition, a dialect).</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted, I don&rsquo;t think every game developer is a perfect little
    angel (far from it, I&rsquo;ve seen what you fuckers write. Jesus <em>wept</em>), with many
    of them getting upset that the committee doesn&rsquo;t approach <em>them</em> for help. This
    is a little silly because this is like a student in college upset that their
    professor didn&rsquo;t magically know to help them with their homework.</p><p>Profiles, as they have been proposed, are effectively just file level
    attributes, as attributes can be ignored by an implementation. This is, as you
    can imagine, <em>no bueno</em> because it relies entirely on a separate tooling
    interface, and does not bake any safety into the language. &ldquo;Oh, but that&rsquo;s
    totally fine. We have static analysis tools.&rdquo; What happens if there&rsquo;s a
    behavior difference? &ldquo;That would never happen!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure some poor fool might
    say.</p><p>Alas, on Windows because they fucked it up, you have to use
    <code>[[msvc::no_unique_address]]</code> over <code>[[no_unique_address]]</code>. Worse, because they
    try to mimic behavior when targeting the MSVC runtime, there is currently no
    way for me to tell Clang on Windows &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only using the C library, and not the
    C++ runtime. Please treat <code>[[no_unique_address]]</code> like normal.&rdquo;</p><p>Microsoft also has never converted any of its useful <code>__declspec</code> declarations
    to attributes. Furthermore, we&rsquo;ve been told <em>time and again</em> that attributes
    cannot be used to change behavior in a given implementation that would change
    how the code operates such that it would cause a compiler error, and yet. Here
    we are being told we can use safety profiles to handle lifetime checks without
    having the need to scan the entire translation unit (or multiple translation
    units).</p><p>The committee <em>could</em> change this precedence rule, but if they did you can bet
    your ass I&rsquo;m showing up with <a href=https://wg21.link/P1283>P1283</a> (<em>Sharing is Caring</em>), because that means
    we could finally standardize exporting our functions for a DLL even though the
    standard doesn&rsquo;t know what the fuck shared library is (and that&rsquo;s why working
    with a shared library is <em>still fucking ass</em> in the modern day)</p><p>P2816 does reference <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)>Ada</a> as an inspiration for profiles. However, there is
    one aspect that is NOT mentioned in that presentation regarding Ada: There is a
    fucking project system built directly <em>into the fucking language</em> that
    determines how source code will compile in relation to each other with said
    profiles, and this is literally one of the first paragraphs Bjarne links to.</p><p class=center><em><strong>C++ HAS NO SUCH THING!</strong></em></p><p>Furthermore, profiles are used to <em>create dialects</em> of Ada, and as we all know
    <em>C++ has no dialects</em> (according to Bjarne). I find it <em>so interesting</em> that
    Bjarne is always referencing language features and then when you look past the
    top level view, it is clear he has not actually used that language in any
    capacity beyond maybe reading a web page, or talking to someone who has used
    it. And it&rsquo;s so very laughable for him to call upon Ada, a language that has
    strong type aliasing, when he was against that being added to C++ years ago
    because &ldquo;we just needed <code>operator .</code>&rdquo;.</p><aside class=important><header><h5>Dear Steve</h5></header><p><p>Steve, please don&rsquo;t get in my mentions online about how great Ada is. I know
    you love it. I&rsquo;ve looked at it. I like it too, minus the

    channels yet but is being presented <em>this very week in Wrocław</em>. In this paper,
    we see several people from Microsoft, including our favorite liar GDR, claim
    that we need to get the feature that is simplest to implement in as soon as
    possible. This paper is a cry for help in corporate speak. Allow me to
    translate the entire paper in just a few small words:</p><blockquote><p>Please don&rsquo;t make us change our compiler parser. Please. 😭 We have no idea
    how to add information to our parser. All our experts are gone, leaving,
    writing Rust, or is just Gaby Dos Reis. We don&rsquo;t want to lose those sweet
    sweet government contracts.</p></blockquote><p>There is a specific sentence in this proposal, however, that nearly made me
    pass out from how detached from reality it is.</p><blockquote><p>Techniques and tools that rely on information already available in C++’s
    semantics should be favored – they scale better while being less intrusive
    than pervasive annotation.</p></blockquote><p>Just one more <code>clang-tidy</code> lint, bro. Just one more <code>clang-analyzer</code> run, dude.
    I promise. Just one more. That&rsquo;ll fix everything. Run <code>clang-scan-modules</code> for
    the millionth time. More external processes. More tools that have to be updated
    separate from the language. Please make your CI/CD take longer because so many
    of you are using GitHub and that&rsquo;s going to increase the amount of minutes your
    runs take and increase the amount of money that Microsoft-owned GitHub can
    charge you. Please oh please. Just one more lint bro.</p><p>A lot has happened as I&rsquo;ve been writing this article, which is why I ended up
    delaying it to this release date. It&rsquo;s one of those &ldquo;weeks where decades
    happen&rdquo; situations. Literally just this past Friday, Google&rsquo;s security blog
    talked about how they&rsquo;re <a href=https://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/retrofitting-spatial-safety-to-hundreds.html>retrofitting spatial safety to hundreds of millions
        of lines of C++</a>. This is all well and good, but it has a serious issue which
    is why we can&rsquo;t just solve these problems at the library level. Sure, this is a
    <em>great</em> solution for old code, but it is <em>ass</em> for new code. For example, we
    don&rsquo;t get any of these hardening primitives at the higher level. There&rsquo;s no
    <code>safe_contiguous_iterator</code> I can use as a mixin to get more safety. I have to
    write it myself, and so does everyone else. Things also fall apart when you get
    to the point where you might be operating directly on pointers.</p><p>And of course, this all worked out so well the last time we tried to rely on
    attributes giving us proper behavior. And this is why the
    <a href=https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/attributes/carries_dependency><code>carries_dependency</code></a> attribute is used by everyone everywhere right? And the
    committee definitely didn&rsquo;t fuck up <code>std::memory_order_consume</code> like 3 - 4
    times (I don&rsquo;t know the actual number, because there&rsquo;s a race condition 😌).</p><p>Also, let&rsquo;s not forget, it&rsquo;s 2024 and there is still not a single build system
    in use that supports every C++ modules without either missing features (the
    most common is <code>import &lt;header>;</code>), or having various crashes (Visual Studio).
    The lack of tooling support in existence taking so long when Gaby is saying we
    need to &ldquo;stop the bleeding&rdquo; shows that we&rsquo;re going to fucking bleed out.</p><p>I do happen to know a thing or two about gunshot wounds, the ones that make you
    bleed out the fastest are sucking chest wounds, and that&rsquo;s what the US military
    cared about the most prior to the &ldquo;war on terror&rdquo;. Then Afghanistan and Iraq
    happened, and what they found was that dudes were dying in large numbers from
    being shot in their extremities if a medic wasn&rsquo;t able to get to them in 2 - 3
    minutes time. So yes, time is of the essence, yet every compiler vendor hasn&rsquo;t
    really rushed to stop the bleeding from the shot in the ass we took called C++
    modules. So, explain to me how <em>the fuck</em> we&rsquo;re supposed to stop the bleeding
    with memory safety when we can&rsquo;t even patch our own ass up.</p><p>This paper is just frankly insulting to anyone who has done the work to make
    safer C++ syntax, going on to call (or at least allude to) Sean Baxter&rsquo;s
    proposal an &ldquo;ad hoc collection of features&rdquo;. Yet another case of Gaby&rsquo;s
    vagueries where he can feign ignorance. As if profiles themselves are not ad
    hoc attributes, that have the exact same problem that Bjarne and others argue
    against, specifically that of the <em>virality</em> of features.</p><p>The C++ committee has had 8 years (8 long fucking years) to worry about memory
    safety in C++, and they&rsquo;ve ignored it. Longer, technically, but none of them
    took Rust seriously in 2015, and to be fair Rust was a bit rough for the first
    year, much like how Golang&rsquo;s first year was also a bit difficult. Yet, WG21
    <em>just doesn&rsquo;t care!</em>.</p><p>As <em>yet another example</em> of them not implementing a feature, we have the case
    of <em>both</em> <code>std::optional&lt;T&></code> (which by the way JeanHeyd also had a solution
    for 6+ years ago, though it is finally making a comeback) and &ldquo;the dumbest
    smart pointer&rdquo;, <code>observer_ptr&lt;T></code>, which was just a non-owning wrapper around any
    pointer that prevents you from doing pointer arithmetic, while providing a
    common interface for generic code so that you can operate on this pointer type
    <em>as-if</em> it were any other smart pointer class such as <code>std::shared_ptr&lt;T></code>,
    <code>std::unique_ptr&lt;T></code>, or proposed pointers like <a href=https://wg21.link/P0468>P0468</a> (<code>retain_ptr&lt;T></code>) by
    yours truly</p><p>Sean Baxter&rsquo;s implementation for both lifetime <em>and</em> concurrency safety
    tracking has been done entirely in his Circle compiler (one thing that has not
    been discussed in depth, is that Rust&rsquo;s approach provides safer concurrency,
    and Bjarne&rsquo;s safety profiles do not!). What many people don&rsquo;t realize is that
    Sean is beyond an extremely talented engineer. I say this with confidence
    because initially, I thought Circle was bolted onto a fork of Clang. It is not.
    It is a clean room, from the ground up, implementation of a C++ compiler. If
    you can name anyone who has written a standards conforming C++ compiler
    frontend and parser and then added metaprogramming <em>and</em> Rust&rsquo;s lifetime
    annotation features to it, I will not believe you until you show them to me.</p><p>Baxter&rsquo;s proposal, <a href=https://wg21.link/P3390>P3390</a> for Safe C++ has a very large run down on the
    various features available to us, effectively giving us a safe upgrade path.
    Don&rsquo;t get it twisted, I don&rsquo;t agree with <em>everything</em> in this paper. For
    example, the introduction of the contextual keyword <code>mut</code> is a bit too much. I
    get wanting to not be verbose, but <code>mutable</code> is only ever used in one place
    semantically, and if there&rsquo;s one thing C++ is good at it&rsquo;s unnecessary reuse of
    the same keyword.</p><p>The main arguments against it so far are:</p><ol><li>&ldquo;it makes a dialect&rdquo; (boo fucking hoo / plin plin plon)</li><li>the annotations are viral (types and attributes are also viral, just FYI)</li><li>It&rsquo;s opt-in, not opt-out</li></ol><p>My responses to each of these are as follows. For starters, stop making the &ldquo;we
    can&rsquo;t have dialects&rdquo; argument, when we&rsquo;ve had dialects for years at this point.
    This is like someone building a massive ship and not thinking about the weight
    of said ship and then putting it out to sea only to see it sink. The &ldquo;no
    dialects allowed RAAAAAH 😡&rdquo; argument sailed years ago. And that ship&rsquo;s name
    was the <em>Vasa</em>.</p><p>Secondly, if the concern is that lifetime annotations, the <code>safe</code> and <code>unsafe</code>
    keyword are viral, what the hell do you think profiles are? Profiles, because
    they rely on attributes, are themselves viral because attributes <em>are also
        annotations</em>. And if the argument is &ldquo;well an implementation is free to ignore
    an attribute&rdquo;, then what the fuck are we doing here claiming this is going to
    make C++ more safe if it can just be ignored by a given implementation???</p><p>Unit tests are technically an optional amount of work to verify one&rsquo;s code is
    correct (if not runtime behavior wise, at least at compile time). The C++
    developer survey, while not reaching every C++ developer, can provide us with
    extremely useful insight regarding the general community&rsquo;s opinion on a given
    subject. And in the case of unit test frameworks, we have the following:</p><figure><img src=/2024/11/on-safe-cxx/get-me-off-this-planet-now.png alt='Screenshot from a C++ developer survey. The question states "Which unit-testing frameworks do you use?" The top 4 answers (in order) are Google Test at 35%, "I don&#39;t write unit tests for C++" at 26%, "I write unit tests but don&#39;t use any frameworks" at 17% and Catch 2 at 12%.'><figcaption>Get me off of this planet now</figcaption></figure><p>26% of responsdents aren&rsquo;t writing unit tests for their C++ code. 1/4th of ALL
    respondents. What a load of bullshit. And we think that suddenly using
    <em>attribute annotations</em> are going to make things safer? Get Real.</p><p>Lastly, yeah it&rsquo;s gonna be opt-in. Just like how Swift&rsquo;s syntax is opt-in,
    because these languages weren&rsquo;t designed with it in the first place. Such is
    life. That&rsquo;s how backwards compatibility works, and profiles are going to work
    in the exact same way. I feel like the people who make this argument are the
    same ones who act like not using Rust for small or fun projects makes you an
    ontological moral failure. If you hold this position, this idea that <em>not</em>
    writing Rust makes someone an objectively terrible human being, please direct
    yourself to the nearest ravine and jump in. These people are insufferable and
    at that point they&rsquo;re just pulling at <del>straws</del> <code>std::string</code>s to find
    something wrong when really they just don&rsquo;t like C++ personally at that stage.</p><p>I also want to make it obvious, I don&rsquo;t have a horse in this race. There are
    two outcomes for whatever happens with regards to profiles.</p><p>The first is that nothing changes. Profiles get made, no one ever turns them on
    or the government says &ldquo;this isn&rsquo;t good enough, try again&rdquo;. C++ joins the ranks
    of languages like COBOL, Bjarne&rsquo;s legacy is that he refused to get out of the
    way and his stubborn nature resulted in him killing his own language, is phased
    out for new projects at government contractors by 2030. Then any C/C++ code
    that I write becomes unusable by the American military and government, and I
    can sleep soundly knowing there is 0 chance of me every writing anything useful
    for the US Government.</p><p>That&rsquo;s an easy, easy win. Zig users might also be in this same place, assuming
    they stay the course and don&rsquo;t <em>want</em> to be used by governments. Rust users
    though, you&rsquo;re gonna have a rough time. Knowing the general political make up
    of so many people in the Rust community, I do question how you will sleep at
    night knowing that an open source library you wrote (and remember the open
    source definition requires no discrimination against use) might get used to
    murder civilians who get reclassified as enemy combatants (and before anyone
    comes screaming into my mentions online, Turkey is still trying to genocide
    Kurdish people)</p><p>The second is that Safe C++ gets approved and added, we hem and haw about
    specifics. Baxter gets burned out from the discussion and takes a step back. We
    get concepts lite but for lifetime annotations and memory safety. C++ continues
    to trundle forward. I, and other people, no longer get treated as an
    ontological moral failure for choosing to not write Rust.</p><h2 id=a-sore-loser>A Sore Loser</h2><p>As I mentioned previously, Bjarne has been going off the wall for a while now
    regarding memory safety. Personally I think NASA moving to Rust hurt him the
    most. He loves to show that image of the Mars rover in his talks. One of the
    earliest outbursts he&rsquo;s had regarding memory safety is a very common thing I&rsquo;ve
    seen which is getting <em>very mad</em> that the definition a group is using is not
    the definition <em>he</em> would use and therefore the whole thing is a goddamn waste
    of time. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, you can go look at however many talks,
    papers, presentations, etc. he has given and you&rsquo;ll see the pattern start to
    repeat: Bjarne doesn&rsquo;t know the definition of memory safety used at large in
    the industry.</p><p>However, the answer to this is very fucking simple: Whatever the US government
    says it is you blithering turd, because that&rsquo;s the only group whose definition
    you have to satisfy, because that&rsquo;s the only group making demands for memory
    safety in C++, and because so many members of INCITS are government or military
    contractors.</p><p>It&rsquo;s interesting isn&rsquo;t it? Bjarne has spent most of his life feeding into the
    American hegemony and their various machinations in some way (e.g., consulting
    on the F22) and then right here at the very end of it all, they&rsquo;ve turned around
    and metaphorically abandoned him, signalling to him that he can either get out
    of the way, or they will <em>make him</em> get out of the way. <em>How dare they</em>. He&rsquo;s
    been such a loyal servant for the machine. How could it just turn around and
    ignore him. Don&rsquo;t they fucking know who he is?</p><aside class=important><header><h5>Under the Bus</h5></header><p><p>This isn&rsquo;t the first time the United States government has thrown supposed

    out members of ISIS, however when Turkey began their attempt at genocide
    against the Kurdish people, many ISIS members escaped.</p><p>As much as I would love to talk in detail about Rojava, their complex
    sociopolitical struggle for autonomy, their interactions on the world stage,
    and how even in the United States we have a large Kurdish diaspora located in
    Tennesee, it is so outside the realm of this blog post, that I need to put a
    pin in it.</p></p></aside><p>In a TikTok <a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@skweezy4real/video/7432398106077007122>video</a> (sorry, I&rsquo;m not in charge of where people post their
    content 🤷‍♀️) posted by niche internet celebrity Skweezy Jibbs (Yes, that
    is his name) just prior to the 2024 US election, he goes on to talk about Trump
    and how Trump <em>cannot</em> lose. Not in the sense of Trump was guaranteed a win
    (though now we already know the results of this election so this statement is a
    bit weak in and of itself), but that Trump has a very specific type of
    personality.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll post a small transcript below:</p><blockquote><p>Trump can&rsquo;t lose.</p><p>But if you ever grew up with somebody who couldn&rsquo;t lose, you know what I&rsquo;m
    talking about. Everything inside of them is broken and even the slightest
    suggestion of loss makes them feel so empty and miserable that they <em>cannot</em>.
    <em>lose</em>.</p><p>And if you haven&rsquo;t grown up with somebody like that, you don&rsquo;t understand
    what that means. So here&rsquo;s what it means: Anything you say to them that
    doesn&rsquo;t make them look like a winner, threatens that. Anything you do, that
    doesn&rsquo;t&mldr; make them look like the best, threatens that.</p><p>And so, it doesn&rsquo;t matter if they&rsquo;re actually going to win or not. They.
    Can&rsquo;t <em>Lose</em>. So yeah, Trump can&rsquo;t lose. It would crush him and he is more
    important than anyone else on Earth to him. He would&mldr; destroy the planet
    just to feel like he&rsquo;s not losing. It&rsquo;s got nothing to do with politics
    homie. Nothing to do with politics.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s not even the most dangerous thing. The most dangerous thing is if
    you have experience with these kinds of people, all you gotta do to completely
    manipulate and control them is make them feel like they&rsquo;re a winner. Tell
    them what they wanna hear, they will give you inroads into anything you want.
    Put a smile on their face? Tell them they have a nice haircut? And they will
    give you the fucking keys to the kingdom. Cause, that&rsquo;s how fragile that
    entire personality is.</p><p>Ask me how I know. Ask me how I got away with shit as a kid by learning how
    to just tell them what they wanna hear and then run the fucking house.</p><p>Now, I stopped this video and I was like I know exactly what they&rsquo;re gonna
    say next.</p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what Trump is about, how come he didn&rsquo;t do that the first time?</p></blockquote><p>He tried. He tried. You remember how many people in his own staff that he
    fired? He would bring people on, like unprecedented amounts of new hires.
    Bring them on board, realizing they weren&rsquo;t gonna do exactly what he wanted,
    then kick &rsquo;em to the curb like it was a revolving door more than like a
    fucking Taco Bell in a bad part of town homie.</p><p>Just constantly pulling people in. &ldquo;Oh they don&rsquo;t wanna do exactly what I
    want? Kick em out&rdquo;.</p><p>[&mldr;]</p><p>And they know, that regular normal people and politicians they&rsquo;re not gonna
    do anything with that [official act], cause it&rsquo;s all based on this
    gentlemen&rsquo;s agreement that goes back hundreds of years.
    [&mldr;]
    Trump doesn&rsquo;t give a shit. He doesn&rsquo;t care.
    [&mldr;]
    And again, it&rsquo;s all based on one thing: Trump can&rsquo;t lose. He <em>cannot lose</em>.
    It&rsquo;s not that big of a deal for him to do all of this shit just to make him
    feel like he&rsquo;s not a loser. He doesn&rsquo;t care about anything other than
    himself. He doesn&rsquo;t care about you. Now he will say he cares about you as
    long as you say that you care about him and that you like him.</p><p>But watch what happens as soon as you disagree with something homie, as soon
    as you do something that doesn&rsquo;t align with his own thoughts of who he is,
    you&rsquo;re fucking done.</p><p>All those people in that first fucking term with him. &ldquo;These are the best, I
    only hire the best&rdquo;, three months later &ldquo;They&rsquo;re the worst, they&rsquo;re the
    fucking worst&rdquo;. Because it&rsquo;s a volatile personality. There is no baseline.
    [&mldr;] There is no &ldquo;oh if I just do this the right way&rdquo;&mldr; Did you see
    Succession? That&rsquo;s exactly what this fucking is homie. If you watched
    Succession, that&rsquo;s not fantasy [&mldr;] that&rsquo;s all written based on real fucking
    people. [&mldr;]</p><p>He can&rsquo;t lose. Everything exists to make sure that he feels like a winner.
    And if anything contradicts that idea of himself in his own head, it&rsquo;s the
    enemy.
    [&mldr;]
    I&rsquo;ve been to countries where you can&rsquo;t talk badly about the people in charge,
    or you go to prison&mldr; <em>or worse</em>. We are not that far away. And you know
    what all these countries have in common? They are all run by people who
    cannot lose.
    [&mldr;]
    I am just telling you, if you don&rsquo;t know this personality type. This <em>toxic</em>,
    <em>narcissistic</em> personality type that cannot lose. And if you don&rsquo;t know what
    they&rsquo;re capable of&mldr; I&rsquo;ve seen what they&rsquo;re capable of as fucking head of
    the PTA and elementary school or head of an HOA. When the guardrails are
    gone, and they&rsquo;ve bullied every opposition down and got in a closet deep
    enough where the regular defenses don&rsquo;t work anymore. Hmph. That&rsquo;s it homie.
    Game over. Game fucking over. Game Over.</p><p>And [&mldr;] even if you are 100% on board the Trump train, I&rsquo;m telling you
    right now homie&mldr; you have no idea where that train ends up cause it&rsquo;s not
    at a station that you wanna get off at. It&rsquo;s at the bottom of a ravine in the
    middle of a burning wasteland for <em>everyone</em>. Except for the one person&mldr;
    who can&rsquo;t lose.</p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s just Bjarne. Oh sure, don&rsquo;t get it twisted, it&rsquo;s different obviously if
    you look at the surface level and are a pedantic goofball. Bjarne isn&rsquo;t a
    billionaire, and he certainly isn&rsquo;t President of the United States. But Bjarne
    <em>cannot lose</em>, and that&rsquo;s why even though the right path is <em>right there</em> he
    (and most of the committee) lack the conviction to actually follow through. As
    I stated earlier he throws tantrums, and who out of the gaslight, gatekeep,
    girlboss trio runs off to tell him whatever he wants to hear? Herb. Because
    Herb has the keys to the fucking kingdom. And Gaby? He does what Bjarne wants,
    so he gets to also have that prestige. Bjarne (and Gaby) will vilify anyone who
    makes it appear as if he has lost, or even if they threaten it.</p><p>As an example, at a 2014 meeting, there was a discussion on <code>operator .</code> and
    out of the room only two people didn&rsquo;t raise their hands in favor of the
    proposal. The first was Chandler Carruth, the other was Mara Bos (who now works
    on the Rust programming language). Chandler successfully explained his position
    on why he was strongly opposed. Gaby Dos Reis turned to Mara Bos, and then
    angrily and loudly <em>demanded</em> she explain her opposition as well. This was
    Mara&rsquo;s second meeting for participating in C++. She was about 1/3rd the age of
    most people there, and felt extremely uncomfortable with the age gap and
    suddenly being put on the spot. Per her words, she stuttered that she agreed
    with what Chandler said.</p><p>In response, Gaby Dos Reis started a very loud rant about how you can&rsquo;t oppose
    something without explaining your position. Except you fucking can. People vote
    <em>strongly against</em> in plenary, in study groups, etc. all the time on the
    committee and they don&rsquo;t explain their answer. Sometimes the most you&rsquo;ll get is
    the white collar worker equivalent of &ldquo;The vibes are just off&rdquo;. But a young
    newcomer says &ldquo;no&rdquo; and suddenly she must account for any action she takes.
    Thankfully, <code>operator .</code> died in the fucking dirt like a rabid dog, and frankly
    good fucking riddance. It was a stupid fucking idea thought up by the absolute
    deranged.</p><p>You can also look at how Bjarne and others talk about Rust despite clearly
    having never used it. And in specifically in Bjarne&rsquo;s case he hasn&rsquo;t even used
    anything outside of Visual Studio! It&rsquo;s all he uses. He doesn&rsquo;t even know what
    a good package manager would look like, because he doesn&rsquo;t fucking care. He
    doesn&rsquo;t care about how asinine of an experience that wrangling dependencies
    feels like, because he doesn&rsquo;t have to.</p><p>It&rsquo;s why he always says there are no dialects. Because if there were dialects
    (and there <em>are</em>, but he&rsquo;ll change the definition because <em>he can&rsquo;t lose</em>),
    then he&rsquo;d have lost. The Vasa sank because of the hubris of the engineers and
    not because of their fear to say no to the system they existed in. Because if
    the latter were true, the Bjane would lose. And we&rsquo;ve already established:
    Bjarne. Cannot. Lose.</p><p>He has never written any actual production code. It is all research code <em>at
    best</em>, it is all C++, he <em>does not know</em> any other language. Imagine how
    delusional it would be if Drew DeVault wrote <a href=https://harelang.org/>Hare</a> and then never touched
    another fucking language for the rest of his life, and never pushed any
    software to production <em>ever</em>, and only used Visual Studio to do any of this.
    That&rsquo;s Bjarne. Oh sure, he talked about a small tool he was writing at CppCon
    once, but AFAIK it was never released.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>The Heart of the Card</h5></header><p><p><p>While writing this I remembered <a href=https://web.archive.org/web/20050901020250/http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/5/28/22428/7034>this article</a> I read a very long time ago, back
    when digg.com still existed (lol, lmao). The gist of this article, was that
    the author didn&rsquo;t believe that Orson Scott Card, with all his bluster had
    actually written his books, and in retaliation he was about to get his ass
    kicked. Now, oddly enough this post from 2005 uses words that actually had
    <em>some</em> weight back then, but unfortunately times have changed</p><p>What really hit me in the gut when rereading this, specifically, is the
    [linked article] by John Kessel. And in <em>that</em> article he goes on to talk
    about abuse at the hands of friends and family and how we are always so quick
    to excuse it when we are children because we put our trust and faith in
    people around us because that&rsquo;s all we know how to do. A lot of discussion
    about how many kids read that book and enjoyed it a great deal is discussed.
    I was one such kid who read Card&rsquo;s work. And you know what my take away from
    Ender and all that drivel attributed to his name was? I couldn&rsquo;t ever lose. I
    had to be perfect. I had to be more than perfect, because that was the only
    way I was ever going to be somebody. And if you weren&rsquo;t trying to be
    somebody, then you deserved to die in a fucking ditch. That was conservative
    America in the mid-00s. At least in the area I lived.</p><p>And I wonder if this is just another aspect of this mindset. Where failure is
    a sign of weakness, even though you have to fail to learn. It&rsquo;s how you
    learn. It&rsquo;s inevitable. <em>To err is human</em> isn&rsquo;t a fucking catchphrase, it&rsquo;s
    literally what makes us human.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a word for all of this, mind you, but if I were to say it now it
    would give away the rest of this section&rsquo;s subject.</p></p></aside><p>We <em>have</em> to accept profiles because otherwise he&rsquo;d be a loser and as we&rsquo;ve
    established <em>he can&rsquo;t lose</em>. So, really&mldr; we never really had a choice did we?
    We never had the opportunity for consensus. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that profiles are
    just shitty epochs. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that we haven&rsquo;t even had it publicly
    confirmed if the US government considers profiles to meet their memory safety
    definition and requirements. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what amount of work Sean Baxter
    put into Circle, and borrow checking, and lifetime annotations. And the reason
    it doesn&rsquo;t matter is because <em>Bjarne can&rsquo;t lose</em>.</p><p>If the US government said profiles don&rsquo;t meet their requirement, he&rsquo;ll just
    move the goal posts <em>again</em> and argue that no, they do in fact meet the
    requirement it is the US government who is wrong and they should apologize
    immediately and allow C++ to be used in space again. I say this sincerely: when
    was the last time you saw anyone in the academic space take on the US Military
    Industrial Complex <em>alone</em> and win? Your brain would have to be smoother than
    hot chocolate at a high velocity to not know the answer.</p><p>I understand that some people might accuse me of bullying an old man. My
    response is that he can retire at any time. He can step down at any time. Even
    Mitt Romney knew when to get out of the game for fuck&rsquo;s sakes. Bjarne&rsquo;s legacy
    could be C++ up until now. He&rsquo;s not responsible for what happens when he&rsquo;s
    done. That he refuses to step down just proves my point I&rsquo;ve made above.</p><p>This kind of behavior really did make me reflect on the committee at large.
    Because this isn&rsquo;t a one off situation. It isn&rsquo;t simply just Bjarne who does
    this. John Lakos of Bloomberg has also done this historically, getting caught
    recording conversations during the closing plenary meeting for the Kona 2019
    meeting because he didn&rsquo;t get his way with contracts. Ville is another,
    historically insulting members and contributors alike (at one point suggesting
    that the response to a rejected paper should be &ldquo;fuck you, and your proposal&rdquo;),
    and I&rsquo;m sure there are others, but I&rsquo;m not about to run down a list of names
    and start diagnosing people like I&rsquo;m a prominent tumblr or deviantart user in
    2017.</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted, there are so many people who very kind and very caring
    and very empathetic on the committee, but they are as powerless as the rest of
    us because they too can be punished for pushing back on Bjarne, Herb, or Gaby.</p><p>In reality, this post isn&rsquo;t really about Gaby Dos Reis, Herb Sutter, and the
    creator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup. I lied. It&rsquo;s about toxic masculinity (oh hey
    <em>there&rsquo;s</em> that word) in language design. Remember when I mentioned the weird
    schoolyard insults and constant bizarre emasculation of Rust and its users?
    Good.</p><p class=center>Because this post is actually about</p><p class=scroll-to-next><a href=#feminism-in-programming-language-design>🔽</a></p><div class=page-break></div><h2 id=feminism-in-programming-language-design>Feminism in Programming Language Design</h2><p>A few weeks ago, Felienne Hermans and Ari Schlesinger published <a href=https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689492.3689809>A Case For
    Feminism in Programming Language Design</a>. Felienne briefly discussed it on
    <a href=https://www.felienne.com/archives/8470>her personal site</a>, and the core gist of all of this is approaching language
    design through the feminist philosophical lens. If feminism is a critique of
    systems, then it would make sense to critique the systems we use to design
    programming languages and the processes by which most languages are designed.</p><p>Now I won&rsquo;t spoil the whole thing, because you <em>really</em> should read this. It&rsquo;s
    a fascinating work, truly, because when you look at how they discuss what a
    language designed through a feminist lens might do in its process of evolution,
    you can see that many well loved languages have already adopted some of these
    approaches simply because they needed a better way to evolve from a community
    perspective. Focusing on user stories and experiences, empathetic (or rather
    informative) error messages, electing people to positions to act as stewards
    rather than authoritative leaders, etc.</p><p>Felienne briefly says in her post</p><blockquote><p>I used to work on spreadsheets—I did very cool things like build refactoring
    tools for spreadsheets—but the only thing people generally cared about was
    telling me over and over that spreadsheets are not programming languages. And
    it never became clear why that is. Argumentation that could easily be refuted
    (yes, spreadsheets are Turing complete, thank you very much) did not help in
    any case: Saying that spreadsheets are code is outside of the Overton window
    of acceptable PL opinions, I learned over and over again.</p></blockquote><p>And yet, I can&rsquo;t help but think of <a href=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf>Build Systems à la Carte</a>, a paper that
    manages to make some good points regarding dynamic build system dependencies
    while also pissing me off because now that it&rsquo;s been published, I get asked
    about it every fucking goddamn time I have the misfortunate of speaking to
    anyone who knows what the fuck a build system is. Please stop asking me if I&rsquo;ve
    read this. I&rsquo;ve read it. Please.</p><p>This paper is unique in that it proceeds to show that Microsoft Excel (a
    spreadsheet application) can represent the dynamic dependency capabilities of
    tools like <code>shake</code>, but this is done more as a gaffe, a punchline. It&rsquo;s as if
    the paper is giving you a wink and a nudge that no one in their right mind
    would <em>ever</em> work in the false language of spreadsheets, but look at how
    complicated we made Excel that it can actually do these things 🤭.</p><p>It&rsquo;s so fascinating that Felienne has been told time and time again by her
    peers and various other curmudgeonly shits that she isn&rsquo;t working in a proper
    programming language environment, but <em>then</em> Simon Peyton Jones of Haskell fame,
    Neil Mitchell and Andrey Mokhov show that Microsoft Excel is a fucking build
    system and <em>therefore</em> it is a complex build tool, but also plays it off as if
    it shouldn&rsquo;t be taken seriously. This undermines Felienne in her work, and
    results in her having to defend herself over and over and over again. These
    people that push back on Felienne, and might cite a paper such as this, are
    typically some of the most insufferable people on this planet, and they will
    find any pedantic excuse to say they are right from the mathematical
    perspective, and <em>they have</em> to be right using <em>facts and logic</em> when in
    reality they&rsquo;re just finding any excuse to not take someone&rsquo;s work seriously.</p><p>These are the same kind of people who used to post on Lambda the Ultimate, a
    now very defunct and dead website that was about academic programming language
    definitions, though if you read any comments on any post ever, you&rsquo;d think they
    all had gotten hemorrhoids from being so butt frustrated that C++ couldn&rsquo;t be
    parsed in a single pass</p><aside class=important><header><h5>Don&rsquo;t get it twisted</h5></header><p><p>Literally, no one has ever given me a reason why this was bad beyond &ldquo;BUT
    MATH THO&rdquo;, which in and of itself isn&rsquo;t a good answer, mostly because as
    stated in the paper linked at the beginning of this section, programming
    doesn&rsquo;t come from math. It had to be <em>made</em> mathematical after the fact to be
    considered mathematical.</p></p></aside><p>Or that C++&rsquo;s templates are turing complete (😱‼‼ THE HORROR) and this is bad
    because then you can do terrible things like&mldr; uhhh&mldr; write bad code,

    history of computing 😔. Truly, all C++ programmers must pay for our crimes of
    writing <code>int main()</code> and then never returning an explicit value 😔. Alas! poor
    Yorrick! He forgot to link in his <code>crt0.o</code>! 😭</p><p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s inconsistent!&rdquo;</p><p>Alright smartass, show me a consistent language and I&rsquo;ll show you a situation
    where someone couldn&rsquo;t lose and they moved the fucking goal posts. Because

    have a broken brain and immediately have an emotional knee-jerk reaction to the
    word feminism. Hell, even just the prefix <em>fem-</em> seems to get some people
    <abbr title="💭 Fem-to... GRIFFITH!!">frothing at the mouth</abbr> as if
    they&rsquo;ve ingested a cyanide pill.</p><p>Regardless, this paper had me briefly re-evaluating a great number of
    programming languages. You might recall in my Wrapping Up 2021 post that I
    lamented it felt like there was no language out there for me that meets all my
    needs and I am still adamant this is the case, though now I&rsquo;m finally able to
    put into words what bothers me about many of these languages and it always
    seems to come down to about 2 or 3 reasons:</p><ol><li>The language has a figure head, usually given the title of <abbr title="Benevolent&nbsp;Dictator For&nbsp;Life">BDFL</abbr>. In some cases
    these are sometimes a small team, working from a metaphorical cathedral or
    ivory tower capacity.</li><li>The language and its community claim that they are trying to <em>simplify</em>
    complexity (perceived or otherwise) found in other languages.</li><li>Comment pragmas</li></ol><p>Let&rsquo;s walk through this list backwards because if I&rsquo;m being honest that 3rd
    argument is me just taking the piss at any language where pragmatic behavior is
    needed, but a comment suddenly has inherent meaning to whatever code you&rsquo;re
    writing. Go, specifically, comes to mind and has influenced countless other
    languages to have something in the same vein, including the <a href=https://c3-lang.org/>c3</a> language. Why
    this is the case doesn&rsquo;t make sense. Yes, certainly there are excuses for
    having chosen this, but it&rsquo;s concerning that a comment can alter the ability
    for your source code to compile. At that point it&rsquo;s not a comment anymore, it&rsquo;s
    just reusing syntax, in the same way C++ reuses <code>static</code> to mean one of
    multiple behaviors.</p><p>Typically, we hear from various developers that the complexity of our software
    is just <em>too great</em> and we need to just simplify things. If only we could break
    all understanding down into simple tasks then anything is doable. Curiously, I
    would argue most people are just simply not aware of how complex of a world we
    live in. Loss of information is dire, and it can be centuries before we can
    rediscover or relearn ancient techniques. In the past few years even, we
    finally figured out greek fire and roman cement.</p><p>Greek fire turned out to just be an extremely low carbon mixture of a natural
    kerosene spring, so it would stay liquid even when not stored in special
    containers. For Roman cement, just a bunch of big ol&rsquo; limestones and when the
    concrete inevitably cracks, the limestone would effectively act as a seal. In
    modern concrete we break these limestones up so our concrete just isn&rsquo;t self
    repairing. The process for understanding these isn&rsquo;t simple, you have to have
    an understanding of chemical reactions. Likewise more modern inventions seem
    to be simple on the surface, until you sit down and think of the complexity
    involved with its construction at a mass scale.</p><p>For example, <em>rockwool</em> isn&rsquo;t a <em>new</em> invention, but it most certainly is still
    effective. Many Americans might be familiar with the cotton candy style of
    fiberglass based insulation. It&rsquo;s useful, it retains heat, burns very slowly,
    and is easily produced. Additionally if you touch it without wearing gloves it
    will fuck up your hands. Rockwool on the other hand is made of a combination of
    actual wool and ceramic fibers intertwined. Imagine if you had a modern day
    loom, that you had to create long ceramic fibers that folded in on themselves.
    That is not a <em>simple</em> construction. However, it is an <em>elegant</em> one, and the
    most you might damage yourself with it is no different than if you were to
    handle wool without any hand coverings. It&rsquo;s also just as fire retardent, and
    is perfectly fine as a building material. It&rsquo;s just more expensive than the
    fiberglass variant (on average).</p><p>I personally feel that we as an industry are so subsumed in our pursuit of
    simplicity, we don&rsquo;t consider that you can have elegant solutions that are
    still complex. Elegance will always beat out simplicity <em>and</em> complexity.
    <abbr title="Domain Name System">DNS</abbr> after all is not simple (lord knows
    the running joke of &ldquo;it was DNS&rdquo; is funny), but it is an <em>elegant</em> design.
    Issues brought about by it have to do with implementation details and not the
    design itself (watch me get someone who was in the room when it was designed
    and implemented tell me I&rsquo;m wrong).</p><p>Truthfully, upon reflection, the largest issue it seems that I have with most
    languages is in fact how they are designed and discussed. As stated in Hermans
    and Schlesinger&rsquo;s paper, they took a look at a programming languages that are
    designed either by one person, but done in a way where leadership is not an
    authoritative figure, as we see in language&rsquo;s like DeVault&rsquo;s <a href=https://harelang.org/>Hare</a> or Kelley&rsquo;s
    <a href=https://ziglang.org/>Zig</a>, but rather acts specifically like that of a steward. Amy J. Ko&rsquo;s
    <a href=https://wordplay.dev/>Wordplay</a>, appears to take this on. How can the language be more user centric,
    how can it be more experimental, and instead of simply requesting that users
    share bug reports or <em>suggest</em> ideas, Ko uses the word <em>share</em>, implying a more
    collaborative effort between creator and audience.</p><p>That said, due to the small size of these communities, their processes are not
    as overloaded as we find with much larger scale languages with committees like
    TC39 (ECMAScript), WG21 (C++), WG14 (C), and more closed groups like, Golang
    (Google), Swift (Apple), Lua (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro)
    and more. These designs (especially in the case of Lua) are very closely
    associated with a cathedral or &ldquo;ivory tower&rdquo; like design. A group in an
    institution meets regularly and then proceeds to hand their decisions down to
    the unwashed masses below, as there is a fear of the &ldquo;tyranny of the masses&rdquo;.</p><p>It is for this reason I think that we see people push back on this so-called
    &ldquo;design by committee&rdquo;, claiming that it is inefficient, slow, unable to respond
    to changes in the world, and increases unnecessary complexity in the language.
    However, I would argue that these are a faux pas, and that the real reason is
    unfortunately due to toxic masculinity.</p><p>It is extremely important for those reading this to understand that the phrase
    <em>toxic masculinity</em> does not mean that all things masculine are inherently
    toxic simply by existing. There are, after all, positive expressions of
    masculinity and you might see this expressed online with memes such as &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
    a hell yeah from me&rdquo; or the more simple comment &ldquo;dudes rock&rdquo;. Rather that this
    particular <em>projection</em> of masculinity hurts those around them, and to a degree
    feeds into narcissistic personalties, as we&rsquo;ve seen with the current state of
    C++.</p><p>Effectively, because of the constant state of toxic masculinity surrounding so
    many men in tech, they are quick to try to make technical arguments so they can
    have their autonomy, because they are to a degree denied this under the current
    sociological approach to software development, especially for language design.</p><p>This also results in a bunch of big dick swinging contests and heated
    outbursts. Though the tweet has since been deleted and <a href=https://twitter.com/croloris/status/1568704125826748416>he apologized</a>, Loris
    Cro of the Zig community at one point called Rust developers &ldquo;safety coomers&rdquo;.
    If I&rsquo;m being honest that heated statement was wholly unnecessary, but this is
    the kind of thing that men have been historically robbed of and this is how
    toxic masculinity damages them. Also, if I&rsquo;m being honest I&rsquo;m so exhausted by
    this. If I wanted to see a dick swinging contest, I&rsquo;d just go to a Bay Area Gay
    Bathhouse. It&rsquo;s not hard. I mean, ok, at the bathhouse&mldr; you know what I&rsquo;m
    gonna just stop this sentence here.</p><p>This is where I&rsquo;ve pondered what kind of collaborative effort would be required
    for a language to be designed without having to give in to these institutions
    that we all seem to think need to exist. After some time, I&rsquo;ve unfortunately
    come to the conclusion that we&rsquo;re not in a space <em>yet</em> where more anarchistic
    organizing can take place.</p><p>For example, one form of anarchist organization is <em>fluid networks</em>. These are
    essentially much like a pick up game of basketball. You show up, you play your
    game. Everyone disperses when the game is done. Repeat as necessary.
    Unfortunately fast moving behavior in languages means this is effectively a day
    to day thing. This means that infrastructure needs to be maintained on a
    regular basis for quick turn around time and improvements, and that requires
    additional knowledge unrelated to the actual tool you are <em>wanting</em> to improve.</p><aside class=important><header><h5>Next time&mldr;</h5></header><p><p>I have so much more I would like to say on developer experience, build system
    infrastructure, and active maintenance of projects but I&rsquo;m gonna have to put
    that into another post in the future, as surprisingly it is out of scope
    here.</p></p></aside><p>This problem is further compounded by the inability for project infrastructure
    to quickly be stood up to support a short running project, and thus these small
    languages turn into research projects or just eventually die off. Surprisingly,
    there is one language that has managed to avoid this at least from a public
    view at scale and that&rsquo;s the Scheme revision. Every couple of years a group
    gets together and then works on and publishes revisions for the Scheme
    implementation of Lisp. Were you to remove the institutional aspect of this,
    and just kind of let people do whatever the fuck they wanted and let it play
    out letting an infinite number of schemes splitting off, dying, smashing back
    into each other, grafting specific aspects onto each other you&rsquo;d find a more
    volatile, but I personally believe more freeing, language development
    environment.</p><p>Sadly, I know for a fact that, as a transgender individual, even discussing
    masculinity and feminism (let alone anarchism) is opening me up to harassment.
    It wouldn&rsquo;t be the first time. I&rsquo;ve been very quiet since 2018 about some
    events that were inflicted upon me by people associated with a specific group.
    This is also where I come in with my confession. I lied again.</p><p class=center>This post isn&rsquo;t about feminism in language design.</p><p class=scroll-to-next><a href=#the-c-alliance>🔽</a></p><div class=page-break></div><h2 id=the-c-alliance>The C++ Alliance</h2><p>On the C++ slack, which is currently administered by the C++ Alliance, I was
    invited to a channel called <code>#on-topic</code>. This was a channel where people could
    more or less say whatever the hell they wanted. It was here where committee
    contributor <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/glenfern/>Glen Fernandes</a> was actively insulting me.</p><p>In a very poor attempt to tell him to fuck off, I incorporated an extremely
    cringe joke regarding my status as a trangender individual. I will not repeat
    it here. However, Glen used this opportunity to harass me for <em>several hours</em>
    regarding my genitals. Pinging me (remember you can&rsquo;t block people on slack,
    and Slack as an organization has never given a damn about this), messaging me,
    and effectively shitting up the channel. Multiple people, including C++
    committee members, begged Glen to stop. He did not.</p><p>Eventually, I lost my cool and threatened him, saying &ldquo;Drop the subject, or the
    next time I see you IRL I will drop you&rdquo;. Eventually, Glen&rsquo;s acquaintance and
    colleague Vinnie Falco (who was at this point the C++ Slack admin) joined the
    channel in an attempt to broker some peace. Glen said he would leave the
    channel and it was &ldquo;up to me&rdquo; when he would be permitted to return. I refused
    to take that responsibility. He is responsible for his own actions, much as I
    am responsible for mine.</p><p>At the San Diego 2018 meeting, I was pulled aside by Herb Sutter. Herb informed
    me that I would be banned if I acted like that again. I had no idea what the
    fuck he was talking about. See, someone had screenshotted the part where I said
    &ldquo;drop the subject or I will drop you.&rdquo; but didn&rsquo;t send the rest of the
    conversation. I informed Herb that I had been harassed for hours leading up to
    that statement. Eventually <em>I</em> took my own screenshots and then sent them to
    Herb. The resulting action was that Glen was not to approach me or talk to me.
    When Arthur O&rsquo;Dwyer&rsquo;s situation was brought up, Arthur was given the benefit of
    the doubt. At no point was he suddenly approached or talked to as if he was
    guilty. I was never afforded that.</p><p>Of course, the harassment didn&rsquo;t stop there. There&rsquo;s another private channel on
    the C++ Slack, one where even worse discussions occurred. This channel was
    called <code>#unfiltered</code> and as far as I&rsquo;m aware, it still exists. And the head of
    the C++ Alliance, Vinnie Falco sits in that channel, or at least he did at the
    time. I do not know if he participated in any conversations that happened in
    there. He let several discussions in there continue, and I was made privy to
    this channel by someone who decided to turn mole. While this person never
    provided any screenshots of the content, I was made aware of when they spoke
    about me. They were very happy when I lost my job in 2018.</p><p>Of course, this brings up the title of this section. The C++ Alliance. Shortly
    after making a shitload of money from the massive rise of value in bitcoin in
    the late 10s, Vinnie Falco proceeded to purchase the C++ Slack under the name
    of this non-profit organization. We&rsquo;re not going to get into the weeds
    specifically on the C++ Alliance but we <em>are</em> going to talk about what Vinnie
    has been doing in recent years.</p><p>The biggest aspect of this is recently funding Sean Baxter&rsquo;s work on the Safe
    C++ proposal. I&rsquo;m not sure if Sean was aware of what Vinnie brings to the table
    in terms of his past actions. I do know from having spoken to several people
    who in turn had spoken to Sean that he <em>had</em> turned down several 7 figure
    offers for his Circle compiler. However, I am not privy too, nor do I wish to
    spend too much time speculating on why Sean took money from which party and for
    what reason.</p><p>What I do know is that Sean Baxter <a href=https://twitter.com/seanbax/status/1855710030894399679>is effectively out of money</a>, and it would
    appear that he is no longer receiving funding from the C++ Alliance in any
    capacity. Without any public statements from Sean, I no longer wish to dwell on
    the subject further.</p><p>The pandemic left all of us so very tired, even the Boost Project has fallen
    behind in its project upkeep. At one point the domain&rsquo;s SSL certificate
    expired. Now, if it were me, I would have setup Let&rsquo;s Encrypt and auto renewing
    for boost years ago, but the boost project moves like absolute fucking
    molasses. And this simply won&rsquo;t do for some people. Using the same tactics as
    Jia Tan (the &ldquo;entity&rdquo; that was able to gain control part of the <code>xz-utils</code>
    project to install a backdoor), Vinnie has been very upset with the Boost
    project, demanding that things move faster, that they modernize, and a variety
    of other things. This is all mostly available in public view. Now, to be fair,
    he and the C++ Alliance are footing the bill for a large amount of work for the
    Boost project. But, he is acting as if the Boost project (a non-profit) owes
    him (or rather, the C++ Alliance) in some financial way. One example of this is
    him talking about the cost of the new <em>proposed</em> (but not yet approved) Boost
    website. This is located at boost.io and I&rsquo;m <em>not</em> going to turn that into a
    clickable link, and that&rsquo;s because this proposed website brings with it a new
    logo.</p><p>This logo features a Nazi dog whistle. The Nazi SS lightning bolts. Here&rsquo;s a
    side by side of the image with and without the bolts being drawn over (Please
    recall that Jon Kalb, who went out of his way to initially defend Arthur
    O&rsquo;Dwyer, serves on the C++ Alliance Board).</p><section class=comparison><figure><img src=boost-toon-overlay.png alt="with overlay"><figcaption>with overlay</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=boost-toon.png alt="without overlay"><figcaption>without overlay</figcaption></figure><small>This cost <a href=https://lists.boost.org/Archives/boost//2024/07/257143.php>$12,000 USD</a> to design</small></section><p>The thing about dog whistles like this is that you can feign ignorance or act
    like someone is seeing something that isn&rsquo;t there, but for something egregious
    it&rsquo;s very hard to defend it in this case. I&rsquo;ll talk about this later in a bit,
    but Vinnie if you are reading this (and I know you at least look at my twitter
    from time to time) if you really do wish to make amends as you stated in 2023,
    get rid of the fucking Nazi SS bolts.</p><p>Of course, there&rsquo;s other political dog whistles out there in the tech world
    right now. <a href=https://justine.lol>Justine Tunney</a> named her C library, <a href=https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan>cosmopolitan</a><sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup>, which <em>I</em>
    personally believe is named after the term <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootless_cosmopolitan>Rootless Cosmopolitan</a>. This is a
    pejorative Soviet epithet which was used primarily during Joseph Stalin&rsquo;s
    antisemitic campaign in the late 40s and early 50s. This is obviously much
    harder to prove<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup> as Justine has done a very good job of deleting some very
    eyebrow raising tweets over the years, even having them scrubbed from The
    Internet Archive&rsquo;s Wayback Machine (in case you weren&rsquo;t aware you <em>can</em> request
    that tweets be removed from the Wayback Machine). She <em>was</em> pretty chuffed
    about ValleyWag and Gawker going away (frankly I never gave a shit about those
    sites), as they&rsquo;d written a piece about her in 2014. Maybe she has changed. She
    doesn&rsquo;t at least <em>publicly</em> talk about her politics anymore, though in her post
    <a href=https://justine.lol/history/>AI Training Shouldn&rsquo;t Erase Authorship</a> the mask almost slips just enough when
    she says</p><blockquote><p>It shouldn&rsquo;t be the case, because no group is doing more right now to elevate
    the universe to a higher state of complexity.</p></blockquote><p>And for <em>me</em> that&rsquo;s a little toooooooo much. Maybe that&rsquo;s some Curtis Yarvin
    Dark Enlightenment shit, maybe it&rsquo;s so-called <abbr title="Effective
Acceleration">e/acc</abbr>. Maybe it&rsquo;s Maybeline. Fuck if I know, but it
    certainly has me weary of any participation Tunney will have in the C++
    community. Given that she recently posted on r/cpp regarding her <a href=https://github.com/jart/json.cpp>json.cpp</a>
    library, I would not be surprised if she starts to show up in places in the C++
    space, even if she continues to write what she calls <em>baroque</em> C++ (the most
    common term I&rsquo;ve seen however is Orthodox C++).</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to just acknowledge your wrongdoings and apologize, at the
    very least. I mean Christ on a corndog, <a href=https://cppalliance.org/vinnie/2023/09/22/Words-Matter-An-Apology.html>Vinnie Falco made an apology</a> (though
    IMHO it is worded poorly, and as I mentioned above the logo for boost does not
    engender any trust for me) for some of his past behavior when he was diagnosed
    as being neurodivergent. For the record, I&rsquo;ve got ADHD so this isn&rsquo;t some
    neurotypical picking on a neurodivergent person kind of thing. Granted, just
    because you&rsquo;re neurodivergent doesn&rsquo;t absolve you of any past behavior. I want
    to be clear, I <em>try</em> to give people a second chance when they own up to fucking
    up, and if they make real active work to make amends. I won&rsquo;t work with them
    during this time (as that is more or less vouching for them), but I will
    fucking lay off the criticism if they are trying to improve themselves, and if
    they leave me alone.</p><p>For example, although Arthur O&rsquo;Dwyer has learnt to keeps his hands to himself,
    he does not pay attention to or notice boundaries and really only focuses on
    his personal agenda. To quote a DM sent to me by a C++ community member about
    Arthur&rsquo;s behavior &ldquo;We are all NPCs to him&rdquo;. He certainly doesn&rsquo;t give a shit.
    He&rsquo;s been creating sockpuppets, and using proxies to get his changes into the
    LLVM and Clang project. Very normal behavior by the way.</p><p>And for Glen, he certainly never attempted to apologize or seek forgiveness for
    his actions despite claiming to be a born again Christian. Then again, as they
    say, there&rsquo;s no hate like Christian &ldquo;love&rdquo;.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>EDIT</h5></header><p><p>I&rsquo;ve been informed, after this post was published, Glen is actually Roman
    Catholic, as if this suddenly excuses the behavior. As we all know, Roman
    Catholics are well known for not having to reconcile or ask seek penance,
    and these are most certainly not any of the seven sacrements.</p></p></aside><p>Justine, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t appear to have made any amends either, at least
    publicly, or even acknowledged her past behavior, though she is more than happy
    to reference her time in the Occupy Wall Street movement. These days however,
    she&rsquo;s busy working on <a href=https://hacks.mozilla.org/2023/11/introducing-llamafile/>llamafiles for Mozilla</a>. For those of you not in the
    know, a llamafile is basically for turning an <abbr title="Large Language
Model">LLM</abbr>&rsquo;s weights into an executable. Which is where this post is
    actually going because <em>surprise shithead</em>, I lied <em>again</em> about this post&rsquo;s
    topic.</p><p class=center>You know what else is really good at noticing a pattern?</p><p class=scroll-to-next><a href=#artificial-intelligence>🔽</a></p><div class=page-break></div><h2 id=artificial-intelligence>Artificial Intelligence</h2><p>Ok, you&rsquo;re probably wondering at this point &ldquo;What the <em>fuck</em> does AI have to do
    with C++, let alone memory safety in C++&rdquo; (that or you&rsquo;re probably along for
    the ride at this stage and are just rolling with it), and it&rsquo;s sadly more
    related than you might realize. AI has obviously gripped Silicon Valley by the
    huevos, and the throat. And as many of us are aware it&rsquo;s being shoved into
    every goddamn nook and cranny. Sadly, I need to actually take a brief detour to
    explain a few things before we circle back.</p><p>Remember earlier in the Feminism in Programming Language Design section?
    There&rsquo;s this aspect of feminism which has to do with bodily autonomy. i.e., You
    and I both have <em>power</em> and that power is over our own personhood. We all have
    a universal passport, and we don&rsquo;t live in an equitable world because not all
    people are granted their autonomy (and in some cases their personhood is
    massively devalued). This is, effectively, a core concept of anarchism, and
    thus the leap from anarchism to feminism in both directions is not too
    extraneous of a jump.</p><p>However, we live in a fairly patriarchical dominated system, one where <em>you</em>
    have to sell your body, but this is coercion through the threat of violence.
    I&rsquo;m very much simplifying it, at least under life in the United States where we
    have to contend with Calvinist work ethics, wealth equating to one&rsquo;s
    verisimilitude, and the idea that &ldquo;only bad things happen to bad people&rdquo;, and
    &ldquo;only bad people don&rsquo;t work&rdquo;. But that threat is starvation (after all if you
    don&rsquo;t work, you can&rsquo;t get paid, and if you can&rsquo;t get paid, you&rsquo;re denied food.
    And if you&rsquo;re denied food, that&rsquo;s starvation. And that&rsquo;s violence), loss of
    shelter, slavery in prison (and yes, it&rsquo;s slavery, as your sentence can be
    extended for failing to perform labor even if you are ill or injured, something
    that Californian residents don&rsquo;t seem to understand but alas), and god knows
    what else.</p><p>There&rsquo;s also the constant desire to put yourself above others who are in
    seemingly worse positions by trying to rely on religious morality. For example,
    it&rsquo;s slightly bemusing to me at least when people who work in the US military
    get mad about sex workers. &ldquo;<em>They sell their bodies! That&rsquo;s a <strong>sin</strong>!</em>&rdquo; a
    high school buddy of mine said circa 2004, who later went on to become an E6
    for the United States Marine Corp. for about 10 years (his favorite flavor was
    razzmatazz for the jarheads reading this 🫡) before coming home bearing
    physical scars from his time in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p><p>This control over one&rsquo;s body, and their sense of self, is something we see
    constantly in the tech industry. How many people reading this begrudgingly
    looked at the layoffs that hit all these <abbr title="Meta, Apple, Amazon,
Netflix, Google">FAANG</abbr> companies and decided &ldquo;yeah, ok. <abbr title="Return To Office">RTO</abbr> is it then&rdquo;? Your coworkers who took that
    RTO severance? That was them exercising their autonomy.</p><p>And so this lack of autonomy has started to infect our technologies. This is
    just technically another branch of neo-feudalism where you don&rsquo;t <em>own</em> jack
    shit. Just look at Windows, they went from calling it &ldquo;My Computer&rdquo; to &ldquo;This
    Computer&rdquo; in less than a decade, and now you can&rsquo;t even move the taskbar away
    from the bottom of the screen without downloading a hack that patches Windows
    and also makes it so you can&rsquo;t update Windows. The Sharif? Straight up gone.
    You can&rsquo;t even <em>lock the taskbar</em>! 😔</p><p>And honestly I&rsquo;m not even getting into the weeds of all the issues with AI.
    Instead we we&rsquo;re seeing people like <a href=https://www.platformer.news/openai-google-scaling-laws-anthropic-ai/>Casey Newton write</a>, AI companies are
    hitting a scaling wall and LLMs are not going to be the path to AGI. That
    doesn&rsquo;t stop people from having insane beliefs about how LLMs work however!</p><p>Some people think that formal reasoning has already been solved! In the WG21
    ISO C++ October 2024 mailing, Andrew Tomazos submitted <a href=https://wg21.link/p3403>P3403</a>, a paper titled
    &ldquo;The Undefined Behavior Question&rdquo; (which HOOBOY man we&rsquo;re just knocking it out
    of the fucking park with possible anti-semitic dog whistles today aren&rsquo;t we?),
    and then when you open this goddamned PDF you realize it&rsquo;s a fucking cleaned up
    transcript of a ChatGPT conversation. Because Andrew thinks that ChatGPT has
    already surpassed human cognition. And he has implied as such on the internal
    reflector, responding to statements that any ChatGPT submitted work would not
    be given time he said:</p><blockquote><p>I really don&rsquo;t think your suggested policy is functional. At the moment it&rsquo;s
    on par with humans, so you might be able to get away with your prejudice for
    now - but what happens when its work becomes clearly and undeniably
    superhuman - which seems like something we&rsquo;ll have to face in about a year at
    the current rate. Are you really going to try and continue to insist on what
    will be clearly inferior human design work? I think that would be
    objectively harmful and an obvious opportunity cost.</p></blockquote><p>Thankfully, not everyone is to quick to believe that ChatGPT as of August 2024
    has achieved sentience and is on par with humans (the people who do? Hoagies
    for brains). Jonathan Wakely of RedHat summed it up in a most eloquent way,
    stating effectively that if Andrew can&rsquo;t bother to write his own fucking
    papers, maybe the committee shouldn&rsquo;t be bothered to read them (do note that
    Wakely did not use the fuck word. He&rsquo;s far too nice to stir up trouble).</p><p>Andrew is certainly interesting. He is quite honestly one of, if not the most
    vocal voice on adding <em>any</em> safety features to C++. In November of 2022, he
    stated:</p><blockquote><p>And as for Rust: I haven&rsquo;t written anything production in Rust, almost noone
    has - but the feedback I&rsquo;ve heard so far from people that have actually tried
    is that working with the borrow checker is a complete nightmare and totally
    restrictive. I&rsquo;m sure if I put a straightjacket<sup>sic</sup> on I couldn&rsquo;t
    hurt anyone but I also sure as hell couldn&rsquo;t play tennis anymore.</p></blockquote><p>Andrew, if you wouldn&rsquo;t mind a moment just between us while everyone else,
    eavesdrops:</p><ol><li>There&rsquo;s plenty of Rust in production you fucking swine of a man. Every
    Windows machine is running Rust. And was running Rust in 2022. Every Nest
    thermostat from Google is running Rust via Fuchsia. You know nothing.</li><li>The borrow checker is only a problem if you don&rsquo;t understand RAII, or don&rsquo;t
    even know how to avoid dangling references. If you find it restrictive
    because it&rsquo;s preventing you from writing race conditions or having dangling
    references, that&rsquo;s a fucking skill issue. Remember, I mentioned earlier in
    this post I&rsquo;m still recovering from brain damage, and I also mentioned I
    don&rsquo;t have a college degree. How the fuck am <em>I</em> able to blaze through the
    borrow checker without any issues, yet the people you&rsquo;ve spoken with fucking
    can&rsquo;t.</li><li>Maybe we <em>should</em> put you in a straitjacket since you seem to be a regular
    Houdini and are magically pulling things out of your ass.</li></ol><p>To end this brief discussion regarding Tomazos, I will post the obligatory link

    are trying to <em>say</em> they&rsquo;ve delivered on their promise. Even if the people in

    working in and around Silicon Valley for a decade now and the only thing that
    has changed is the weather is worse and the number of people in San Francisco
    after the pandemic is fewer, and some people have tried to act like the world
    is the same. &ldquo;Move to the Bay Area. Let&rsquo;s change the world.&rdquo;</p><p>We&rsquo;ve had a decade to change it and Things Are Worse Now™. I need more RAM to
    use websites because people are out of control, and <a href=https://htmx.org/>htmx</a> can only do so much.
    Google barely works anymore. DuckDuckGo is a privacy wrapper around Bing
    search. Death Valley is turning into a salt lake. We&rsquo;re running out of
    phosphorous. We&rsquo;re running out of top soil. We&rsquo;re never getting a Titanfall 3.</p><p>All of this just sucks ass, man. The stagnation is enough to hollow you from
    the inside out. Kill your enthusiasm and burn you out, leaving nothing but a
    smoldering cinder. Not all of us have the energy to fetch a new ember.</p><p>This article wasn&rsquo;t ever really about C++ <em>the language</em>. It was about C++ <em>the
    community</em>, because that&rsquo;s what C++ really is. Bjarne is too caught up in his
    own bullshit to see it, same as Herb and Gaby, and as long as this is the
    situation we&rsquo;re in, C++ will never be &ldquo;safe&rdquo; as a community. You could have the
    perfect language, but if no one uses it, because there&rsquo;s no community, what do
    you have?</p><p>Sure, I could go off and write my own language. I would just end up as another
    BDFL, like so many before me. The cycle would continue. A different cycle, from
    the C++ committee&rsquo;s adamance that we must keep marching forward, lest we end up
    like the Vasa (LOL, LMAO). Yet, <em>another cycle</em> still. It doesn&rsquo;t solve any
    problem except to make <em>myself</em> feel better.</p><p>C++ is not in a unique situation. Far from it. This story has been told before.
    Leadership refusing to let the next epoch come around, destroying themselves
    and the world in the process. Leaving the rest of us to pick up the pieces,
    convincing some of us to take on a mandate to repeat this cycle, to make sure
    the world stays out of the hands of those would change it, while others shirk
    this mandate and take upon themselves a different path. Discouraging jolly
    cooperation, as long as we think we only have these two options before us.</p><p>By now, you probably already see the skull below, instead of the arrow you&rsquo;ve
    typically seen until now, ready to take you to the final section of this post.
    It&rsquo;s still about C++ <em>the community</em>, this I promise you. I&rsquo;m not going to give
    you some profound wisdom, some answer to this problem. I&rsquo;m simply going to
    express what I feel C++ has become, to reveal its true identity. All I need is
    your help.

Honestly, if you hadn&rsquo;t figured out the bit at the very end of
    those last few paragraphs there, I don&rsquo;t know what else to tell you, other than
    you might be uncultured for the modern era. I know, the joke here is <em>so</em>
    obvious it&rsquo;s effectively cringe. &ldquo;oh c++ is the dark souls of programming
    languages haha&rdquo; I shout as I am thrown into a ravine at mach 3.</p><p>Without spoiling the lore or the games too much because you can easily watch
    any set of videos on the subject in more detail than I could ever hope to give,
    but as a small summary, it basically plays out like the following. Gwyn, Lord
    of Cinder, and his buddies overthrow the prevailing social order and enter the
    Age of Fire. As the fire begins to fade, Gwyn is afraid of the coming Age of
    Dark. He immolates himself to keep the fire burning, upsetting the natural
    order of the world. The player is tasked with rekindling (called &ldquo;linking&rdquo;) the
    fire. Some players can choose to walk away, and let the Age of Dark happen.</p><p>Onwards to Dark Souls 2. The fire has been linked so often that no one
    even questions the act. It&rsquo;s just A Thing You Do™. It has also been abandoned
    and allowed to fade so often that it&rsquo;s just A Thing You Do™. Everyone is going
    through the motions. One man recognizes the cycle is inevitable. He tries to
    break out of it. He becomes a monster. His brother is so terrified of a choice,
    he locks himself away until he becomes a shambling mess.</p><p>We fast forward to Dark Souls 3. It is the end of all things. The fire has been
    rekindled so much that everything has been reduced to ash. The fire will fade,
    the fire will be reborn. None of it matters, all of reality is collapsing. All
    of this could have been avoided if Gwyn hadn&rsquo;t upset the natural flow. If he&rsquo;d
    just stepped aside and let the world take its course without his interference.</p><p>This is the state C++ is in, though as I&rsquo;ve said plenty of times in this post,
    don&rsquo;t get it twisted. Bjarne ain&rsquo;t no Lord of Cinder. We&rsquo;re stuck in a cycle of
    people joining the committee to try to improve the language, burning out and
    leaving, or staying and becoming part of the cycle of people who burn out the
    ones who leave.</p><p>We&rsquo;re seeing this happen in real time, in relation to <abbr title="The
Honorable Deez Nutz presiding">Stroustrup v. Baxter</abbr>. Sean can go off
    and implement his own language. He technically already has. Stroustrup is too
    stubborn to let anyone else make a change this important. They are more alike
    than you might realize.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve effectively been holding back on some context. You would be forgiven for
    thinking that I&rsquo;m entirely on Team Baxter and that I&rsquo;m just raging against the
    machine. Sean <em>is</em> assuredly a talented engineer, but he does have one flaw and
    that is, based off of conversations relayed to me by community members and
    committee contributors, he does not appear to trust anyone else to take the
    reins of getting memory safety into C++. Furthermore, one of my sources claimed
    he believes himself to be the smartest person in the room. Obviously this can
    turn people off to wanting to collaborate, and assuredly in the case of a
    narcissist would most definitely piss them off, which is why Gaby has continued
    to thinly insult Sean at every opportunity.</p><aside class=note><header><h5>Stubborn</h5></header><p><p>Granted, he&rsquo;s not the only one on the committee like this. I&rsquo;ve been told
    Barry Revzin&rsquo;s behavior is similar, and he&rsquo;s attempted to get proposals by
    one individual descheduled on more than one occasion, claiming that
    (paraphrased via my source) &ldquo;his papers are stupid&rdquo; and the &ldquo;committee should
    spend more time on my papers and not on stupid papers&rdquo;. Personally I think
    that&rsquo;s a little hubristic given that the <code>^^</code> reflection syntax is dumb as hell
    and the only reason <code>^</code> was selected initially was because it was believed to
    be unused.</p></p></aside><p>I mentioned earlier, that in Dark Souls 2, a man tried to break free of the
    cycles of linking the fire and letting the flame fade. He failed, but you play
    a chosen undead of no renown (you&rsquo;re Just Some Guy™). At the end of Dark Souls
    2, you&rsquo;re given a choice. Sit upon the Throne of Want, wait your turn and
    continue the cycle. Or just walk away, let come what may, and venture forth
    into the unknown. Forever searching.</p><p>It&rsquo;s 2024. Modules fucking suck, contracts have been in design for years and I
    could not tell you what they look like because there are at least 17 different
    answers depending on who you&rsquo;re talking to. There&rsquo;s still no networking.
    Senders/Receivers are literally whatever, <code>co_await</code> as syntax is still a
    disgrace, I can&rsquo;t use placement <code>::new</code> for coroutines, people still think we
    don&rsquo;t have dialects because they pull a no true scotsman, and every other
    programming language out there just doesn&rsquo;t have the momentum or feature set
    for me to <em>enjoy</em> writing code. There&rsquo;s no whimsy anymore, just like everything
    else.</p><p>I feel like, metaphorically of course, that I am currently at that threshold.
    Before me, a throne of want(ing to make a better language), behind me another
    path. Walk amongst the rest of the world, waiting for an end to arrive whatever
    that might be.</p><p>I&rsquo;m very well aware I&rsquo;ve broken some rules here, but <abbr title="I'm entering
my anarcho-trotsky era. It's joever for me.">I stand by my sources</abbr>, and
    as I&rsquo;ve specified throughout this post, the C++s committee is rife with vicious
    narcissists and they&rsquo;re going to come after me to punish me, and make an
    example of me. They&rsquo;re going to try to silence me, crucify me even if I can get
    poetic with it for a hot second. I won&rsquo;t take it lying down obviously, but it&rsquo;s
    important to make the distinction that no matter what they do, they can&rsquo;t fully
    control the industry at large and that drives them insane.</p><p>They <em>have</em> to fall back onto controlling the narrative <em>where</em> they can. A
    great philosopher, who has inspired an entire generation, once said &ldquo;<em>Who
        controls the past now, controls the future. Who controls the present now,
        controls the past.</em>&rdquo; It doesn&rsquo;t matter what these committee members do to me,
    it doesn&rsquo;t matter what snake oil they pander to the C++ community at large. It
    doesn&rsquo;t matter what gets written down in any official record, because</p><p class="center xxl" style=font-family:var(--title-font);text-transform:uppercase><strong>A <em>lie</em> will remain a <em>lie</em></strong></p><p class="center xxl bluesky nomargin"></p><p class=center><a href=https://bsky.app/profile/izzys.casa>Follow Me On BlueSky, You Can&rsquo;t Lose 😎</a></p><div class=quarter-break></div><div class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1><p>For example in my <em>Wrapping Up 2021</em> post, I mentioned that Bjarne looked

    two counts of <strong>RAPE OF A DRUGGED VICTIM/POSSESSION OF CHILD PORNOGRAPHY</strong>.
    His victim was under the age of consent. He served 120 days in jail, and
    was sentenced to 3 years of probation. He is currently registered with the
    State of New York. I am unable to provide the California Court Record at
    this time. However, I was able to verbally verify with the Criminal Justice
    Department of the State of New York that he was downgraded to a Level 1
    threat in 2023 for <em>one</em> of his two convictions. The other is still at a
    Level 2 threat. Because one of his threats is at a Level 1, he can no
    longer be searched for on the NY State Sex Offender Registry without first
    calling said Criminal Justice Department. Information is provided at <a href=https://www.criminaljustice.ny.gov/SomsSUBDirectory/search_index.jsp>the
        bottom of this page</a> to call and confirm Arthur&rsquo;s status. I was able to
    provide his offender ID, which is <code>49602</code>. Lastly, <a href=https://dailyvoice.com/new-york/yonkers/news/sex-offender-convicted-of-raping-drugged-victim-reports-move-into-yonkers/773166/>this article from The
        Daily Voice</a> is what tipped various people off to Arthur&rsquo;s status in 2021.
    This article does not provide Arthur&rsquo;s current address. He does not reside
    in Yonkers anymore. I will not be providing his address under any
    circumstances, as this would warrant harassment and open myself up to
    litigation. I hereby state that everything in this footnote is accurate,
    and I had my phone call with the Criminal Justice Department at 11:33 AM
